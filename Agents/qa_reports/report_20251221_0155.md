-------------------------------------------------
Total: 67/98 (68%) | Blocked by: 2 CRITICAL issues
```

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Fixer Agent:** Process latest QA reports immediately
2. **Priority Fix:** Replace `db.delete()` with soft delete pattern:
   ```python
   # Instead of: await db.delete(sequence)
   sequence.deleted_at = datetime.utcnow()
   await db.commit()
   ```
3. **Builder:** Can proceed with remaining Phase 7 tasks (API-003, API-004) in parallel while Fixer addresses violations
