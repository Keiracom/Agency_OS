## Revised Mission Order

Based on this analysis, the mission order changes:

1. ~~SIEGE integration~~ Still important, but not first
2. **Trust infrastructure** (landing page, LinkedIn, legal)
3. **Demo capability** (booking, script, deck)
4. **Close capability** (proposal, contract, payment)
5. **Onboarding flow** (tested end-to-end)
6. Then technical completion (SIEGE, etc.)
7. Then outreach

**Can't sell what we can't deliver. Can't demo what doesn't exist. Can't reach out if nobody trusts us.**

*This is the analysis I should have done from the start. Dave was right to call it out.*
