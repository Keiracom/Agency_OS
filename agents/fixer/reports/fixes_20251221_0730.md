## ESCALATED TO HUMAN

| File | Line | Issue | Severity | Reason |
|------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| PROGRESS.md | 139 | Out of sync with cmo_agent.py | HIGH | Protected file - Builder's responsibility |

**Details:**

**ESCALATE-001:** PROGRESS.md
- **Issue:** PROGRESS.md shows AGT-002 (CMO agent) as "🔴 Not Started" but cmo_agent.py exists with full implementation
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **QA Report:** Agents/qa_reports/report_20251221_0012.md (HIGH-001)
- **Why I Can't Fix This:** Per Fixer Agent protocol, PROGRESS.md is a protected file that only the Builder Agent can modify
- **Recommended Action:** Builder should update PROGRESS.md to mark AGT-002 as complete
- **Added to:** fixer_reports/needs_human.md

---

## SKIPPED (MEDIUM/LOW severity)

| File | Line | Issue | Severity | Reason |
|------|------|-------|----------|--------|
| src/agents/__init__.py | - | Missing cmo_agent exports | MEDIUM | Per protocol |

**Note on MED-001:** Upon inspection, this issue appears to be ALREADY RESOLVED. The `src/agents/__init__.py` file (lines 22-29, 52-58) already contains:
- `from src.agents.cmo_agent import CMOAgent, get_cmo_agent, ...`
- `"CMOAgent"` and `"get_cmo_agent"` in `__all__`

The QA report (timestamp 00:12 UTC) may have been generated before the Builder updated this file. QA should verify this is now clean in next scan.

| Fixes Applied | 0 |
| Re-attempts | 0 |
| Escalated | 1 |
| Skipped | 1 (already fixed by Builder) |

## FOR QA VERIFICATION

QA Agent: Please verify in your next scan:

| File | Check For |
|------|-----------|
| src/agents/__init__.py | CMOAgent and get_cmo_agent ARE exported (should be clean) |
| PROGRESS.md | Still out of sync (awaiting Builder update) |

---

## OBSERVATIONS

1. **MED-001 is stale:** The cmo_agent exports already exist in __init__.py
2. **HIGH-001 requires Builder:** PROGRESS.md is outside Fixer scope
3. **Actual fixable issues this cycle:** 0
