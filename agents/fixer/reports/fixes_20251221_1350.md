### HIGH-001: Admin Dashboard Pages Incomplete

- **Location:** frontend/app/admin/
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Description:** Only 1 of 20 required admin pages exists
- **QA Reference:** report_20251221_0220.md

**Analysis:**

This issue reports **missing files** that need to be **created**, not fixes to existing code:
- 19 frontend page files do not exist
- These need to be written from scratch per the spec

**Fixer Protocol Check:**
| Authority | Applies? |
|-----------|----------|
| Fix existing code | ❌ No code to fix |
| Create new files | ❌ NOT AUTHORIZED |
| Add new features | ❌ NOT AUTHORIZED |

**Conclusion:** This is a **Builder task**, not a Fixer task.

## EXISTING CODE VERIFICATION

The existing Admin Dashboard code was verified clean:

| File | Status |
|------|--------|

| frontend/app/admin/layout.tsx | ✅ No issues |

## SUMMARY

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Issues in Report | 1 |
| Fixable by Fixer | 0 |
| Escalated to Builder | 1 |
| Fixes Applied | 0 |

---

## FOR QA

HIGH-001 is not a code defect — it's incomplete implementation. Builder needs to create the remaining pages. Fixer Agent cannot create new files.
