## FIXES APPLIED

### Fix #1: CRIT-001

- **File:** src/orchestration/flows/pattern_learning_flow.py
- **Line:** 158
- **Issue Type:** Hard delete violation (CRITICAL)
- **Rule Violated:** Rule 14 - Soft deletes only
- **QA Reference:** CRIT-001

**Before:**
```python
            # Delete expired pattern
            await db.delete(pattern)
```

**After:**
```python
            # FIXED by fixer-agent: converted to soft delete (Rule 14)
            pattern.deleted_at = now
```

**Verification Point:** Line 158 should use `pattern.deleted_at = now` instead of `await db.delete(pattern)`
