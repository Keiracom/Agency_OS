# ESCALATED ISSUES - Needs Human Review

**Last Updated:** Not yet updated by Fixer Agent

These issues require human (CEO) intervention because Fixer cannot resolve them.

## Escalation Criteria

Issues are escalated here when:
1. **Architectural change needed** — Multiple files must change together
2. **Unclear intent** — Fixer doesn't know correct behavior
3. **Circular dependency** — Multiple valid solutions exist
4. **External change needed** — API key, config, database change required
5. **Repeated failure** — Same issue failed 3+ times
