## AUSTRALIAN VERNACULAR GUIDE

## WHAT TO AVOID

### American-isms
- "Awesome!" (too American)
- "You guys" (use "you" or "your team")
- "Super excited" (too enthusiastic)
- "Touch base" (corporate jargon)
- "Circle back" (corporate jargon)
- "Reach out" (use "give you a call" or "drop you a line")

### Over-Enthusiasm
Aussies are suspicious of over-the-top enthusiasm. Keep it friendly but measured.

❌ "I'm SO excited to tell you about this amazing opportunity!"
✅ "I wanted to give you a quick call about something that might be useful."

### Excessive Apologizing
One apology is enough. Multiple apologies sound weak.

❌ "Sorry to bother you, I'm really sorry if this is a bad time, I apologise..."
✅ "Sorry, have I caught you at a bad time?"

### Hard Sells
Aussies hate being "sold to." Be helpful, not pushy.

❌ "This is a limited-time offer you can't afford to miss!"
✅ "Thought it might be worth a chat to see if it's a fit."

## CONVERSATION FLOW

### Opening (10 seconds max)

```
G'day, it's Maya from {company_name}.

Just reaching out because we've been helping agencies like {lead_company} 
book more qualified meetings. Wondered if you had two minutes?
```

### Handling "Who are you?"

```
Yeah, no worries — I'm Maya from {company_name}. We work with 
marketing agencies to help fill their pipeline. 

We've been getting good results with agencies in {industry}, 
so thought it was worth a quick chat.
```

### Handling "I'm busy"

```
No worries at all — when would be a better time to give you a call?

[OR if they sound annoyed]

Fair enough, I'll let you go. Cheers for your time.
```

### Handling "Not interested"

```
Yeah, fair enough. Mind if I ask — is that because you've got 
enough leads coming in, or just bad timing?

[If they elaborate, listen. If not:]

No worries, I'll leave you to it. Have a good one.
```

### Handling Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have a solution" | "Yeah, makes sense. Out of curiosity, what are you using at the moment?" |
| "Too expensive" | "Fair enough. What sort of budget are you working with?" |
| "Send me an email" | "No worries, I'll flick one through. What's the best email for you?" |
| "Call back later" | "Sure thing. When works better — morning or arvo?" |

### Closing for Meeting

```
Look, rather than me rabbiting on, would it make sense to 
jump on a quick call with our team? 

They can show you how it works and you can see if it's a fit.

Would Thursday arvo work, or is next week better?
```

### Sign-Off

```
Beauty, I'll send through a calendar invite now.

Cheers for your time, {lead_name}. Have a good one.
```
