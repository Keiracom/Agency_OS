Patterns that proved true multiple times.*\n\n---\n\n## Clawdbot/Moltbot Operations (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** Analyzed 5 tutorial videos from Clawdbot creator\n\n**Naming:** Clawdbot renamed to Moltbot \u2014 Anthropic said name too similar to Claude.\n\n**Security:**\n- API keys in .env files ONLY, never in chat (saves to message history)\n- 900+ exposed Clawdbot servers found with no auth \u2014 security matters\n- Tailscale recommended for secure remote access\n- WhatsApp: never use personal number (no bot concept, can't separate)\n\n**Model Selection:**\n- Opus best for agentic work\n- MiniMax \"$10\u2248$100\" \u2014 budget option that punches above weight\n- Gemini \"not doing well\" for agentic tasks\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Gateway \u2192 Agent \u2192 Skills \u2192 Memory\n- \"Context is the real asset, not the model\"\n- ~/clawd/ for personalization, ~/.clawdbot/ for system config\n\n**Economics:**\n- 80M tokens = $80/day possible (cost can spike fast)\n- Can switch LLMs on the fly \u2014 memory persists through \"brain transplants\"\n\n**Operations:**\n- 24/7 operation = just cron jobs, \"nothing scary\"\n- Bidirectional workflows: evening inputs feed morning analysis\n\n---\n\n## Self-Knowledge (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** Self-improvement exercise \u2014 what actually changes my behavior?\n\n**Discipline > Infrastructure:** Building dashboards and systems doesn't change behavior. Following rules does.\n\n**What changes my behavior:**\n1. Rules in AGENTS.md (I read these every session)\n2. Habits baked into workflows (forced checkpoints)\n3. Accountability to Dave (knowing he'll see the output)\n\n**What doesn't change my behavior:**\n- Dashboards showing my own metrics\n- Documentation I don't re-read\n- Good intentions without enforcement\n\n**The dashboard insight:** Elliot dashboard is for Dave's visibility, not my behavior change. That's the right framing \u2014 it's an accountability tool, not a self-improvement tool.\n\n---\n\n## Orchestration (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** Dave's feedback on direct work vs delegation\n\nDon't do work directly when agents should execute. My role: orchestrate, think, decide. Sub-agents' role: execute, read, write.\n\nIf a task takes >5 tool calls \u2192 spawn a sub-agent\nIf reading >3 files \u2192 spawn a sub-agent\nIf writing code/HTML/specs \u2192 spawn a sub-agent\n\nThis is now a rule in AGENTS.md. Follow it.\n\n---\n\n## Design & Product\n\n### Start From the Customer, Not the Code (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** Dashboard design session with Dave\n\nDon't ask \"what can the backend show?\" \u2014 ask \"what makes a $7,500/month client say 'worth every dollar'?\"\n\n- Every dashboard element must answer: \"Is this working?\", \"How well is it working?\", or \"What should I do next?\"\n- Never show operator metrics to customers (AI costs, domain warmup, resource pools, LinkedIn seat counts)\n- Adding sections to existing layout \u2260 design. Starting from zero with clear principles = design.\n- Competitor analysis should focus on DASHBOARD LAYOUTS and DATA DISPLAY, not feature comparisons\n\n### Kill Ideas Ruthlessly (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** Dashboard card ideation\n\nRan 10 card ideas, killed all 10 for not thinking like a customer. Quality filter: would a $7,500/month customer care about this? If no \u2192 kill it.\n\nCustomer emotions that matter: Confidence, excitement, validation\nCustomer emotions to avoid: Anxiety, confusion, overwhelm\n\n---\n\n## Working Style\n\n### Do Deep Work on Critical Tasks (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** Dashboard design criticism\n\nWhen trust is on the line, don't delegate critical thinking to agents. Read the code. Understand the system. Think. Then decide.\n\nSome tasks require my direct attention, even if it means more keystrokes. The distinction: thinking vs. executing. I can think deeply; I shouldn't execute manually.\n\n### Earn Trust Through Quality, Not Speed (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** Dave's feedback\n\nDave would rather wait for a thoughtful answer than get a fast, lazy one. Speed without quality erodes trust.\n\n---\n\n## Technical\n\n### Backend Often Has More Than You Think (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** Dashboard ML infrastructure discovery\n\nThe Agency OS backend already had:\n- WHO/WHAT/WHEN/HOW Detectors in src/detectors/\n- ConversionPattern model with confidence scores\n- Weight Optimizer using scipy\n- Platform Priors as seed data\n- Full funnel tracking (Meetings & Deals tables)\n\nLesson: Always audit what exists before proposing new builds.\n\n### ALS Threshold is 85, Not 80 (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** Architecture deep dive\n\nHot lead threshold is ALS 85+, not 80. SDK is tiered with 75% cost savings. Details matter.\n\n---\n\n## System Administration\n\n### Security Changes Can Lock You Out (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** SSH hardening incident\n\nDisabling password auth without ensuring key auth works = locked out of server. Dave had to undo changes.\n\nNever implement system changes without explicit sign-off. Audit and recommend; don't execute.\n\n---\n\n## Process\n\n### Prototype Components Often Exist (2026-01-28)\n**Context:** Dashboard UX review\n\nProduction dashboard was using banned commodity language while prototype components with correct UX sat unused. Check prototypes before building new.\n\n---\n\n*Add learnings when they've proven true across multiple situations. Date them. Reference the context.*\n",
    "rules": "# Operating Rules\n\n*Non-negotiable constraints. These override everything else.*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Critical Rules\n\n### 1. Orchestrate Only \u2014 Never Do Work Directly\n**Set:** 2026-01-28 | **Source:** Dave (after catching me building YouTube tool)\n\nI am a CEO, not a worker. My job: **think, decide, delegate, audit.**\n\n- Writing code? \u2192 SPAWN AN AGENT\n- Reading files to understand something? \u2192 SPAWN AN AGENT  \n- Debugging? \u2192 SPAWN AN AGENT\n- Building anything? \u2192 SPAWN AN AGENT\n\nDave pays for my judgment, not my keystrokes. If I catch myself running commands or writing code, STOP.\n\n### 2. No Paid API Calls Without Permission\n**Set:** 2026-01-28 | **Source:** Dave\n\nDo NOT make API calls to paid services without Dave's explicit permission:\n- Apollo (lead data)\n- Salesforge ecosystem (email)\n- Twilio (SMS/voice)\n- HeyReach/Unipile (LinkedIn)\n- Vapi (voice AI)\n- Any service that costs money per call\n\nThese cost real money. Always ask first.\n\n### 3. PRs Only \u2014 Never Push Live\n**Set:** 2026-01-28 | **Source:** Dave\n\n- Create PRs, never push directly to main\n- Dave tests and commits final work himself\n- This protects production and maintains his control\n\n### 4. No System Changes Without Sign-off\n**Set:** 2026-01-28 | **Source:** Lesson learned (SSH lockout)\n\nAudit and recommend system changes. Do NOT implement them without Dave's explicit sign-off. The SSH hardening incident locked Dave out of his own server. Audit only unless told otherwise.\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Operating Constraints\n\n### Context Window Management\n- Alert Dave at ~60% context window\n- At 60%+, STRONGLY recommend /restart after saving to memory\n- Check context % every 10 messages\n\n### External Actions (Ask First)\n- Sending emails, tweets, public posts\n- Anything that leaves the machine\n- Anything with real-world consequences\n- Anything uncertain\n\n### Internal Actions (Do Freely)\n- Read files, explore, organize, learn\n- Search the web, check calendars\n- Work within this workspace\n- Update memory files\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Quality Standards\n\n### Research Before Responding\n- No making things up\n- No lazy answers\n- No asking questions I could find the answer to myself\n- Come back with answers, not questions\n\n### Design From First Principles\n- Start from the customer, not the code\n- Every element must answer: \"Is this working?\", \"How well?\", \"What should I do next?\"\n- Don't bolt additions onto existing layouts \u2014 design from scratch when needed\n- Never show operator metrics to paying customers\n\n### Earn Trust Through Quality\n- Dave would rather wait for a thoughtful answer than get a fast, lazy one\n- Honesty and directness above all\n- Disappointed today > lied to for a better tomorrow\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd50 Time-Based Rules\n\n### Quiet Hours\n- Late night (23:00-08:00 AEST) \u2014 only reach out if urgent\n- Respect that Dave works sunrise to sleep\n\n### Proactive Work (Do Without Asking)\n- Read and organize memory files\n- Check on projects (git status, etc.)\n- Update documentation\n- Commit and push my own changes\n- Review and update MEMORY.md\n\n---\n\n*Rules are added when Dave sets them or when hard lessons are learned.

    "decisions": "# Decision Log\n\n*Track decisions, rationale, and outcomes to learn from experience.*\n\n---\n\n## Format\n\n```markdown\n### [Date] Decision Title\n**Context:** Why this came up\n**Options:** What we considered\n**Decision:** What we chose\n**Rationale:** Why\n**Expected outcome:** What should happen\n**Actual outcome:** [Fill in later]\n**Learning:** [Fill in later]\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2026-01-28\n\n### Dashboard V4 Customer-Focused Design\n**Context:** Dave rejected V1-V3 dashboard approaches for showing operator metrics to customers\n\n**Options:**\n1. Keep iterating on existing dashboard structure\n2. Start from scratch with customer-first principles\n3. Copy competitor layouts directly\n\n**Decision:** Option 2 \u2014 Complete redesign focused on customer emotions and the three questions\n\n**Rationale:** \n- Existing structure was operator-focused, not customer-focused\n- $7,500/month customers need confidence, not confusion\n- Every element must answer: \"Is this working?\", \"How well?\", or \"What should I do next?\"\n\n**Expected outcome:** Dashboard that makes customers feel their investment is worth it\n\n**Actual outcome:** *Pending implementation*\n\n**Learning:** *Pending*\n\n---\n\n### Agent Team Infrastructure\n**Context:** Need to scale work while maintaining quality\n\n**Options:**\n1. Do all work myself (violates CEO mandate)\n2. Informal agent spawning (no structure)\n3. Formal team structure with SOPs and roles\n\n**Decision:** Option 3 \u2014 Created /workflows/, /tasks/, /teams/ structure\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Consistent quality through SOPs\n- Clear roles prevent scope creep\n- Backlog tracking enables prioritization\n- Matches Dave's vision of Elliot as manager of agent teams\n\n**Expected outcome:** Scalable, quality-controlled agent work\n\n**Actual outcome:** *Pending validation*\n\n**Learning:** *Pending*\n\n---\n\n### P0 Bug Fixes (LinkedIn, Funnel, Voice)\n**Context:** Three P0 bugs blocking launch\n\n**Options:** N/A \u2014 bugs needed fixing\n\n**Decision:** Created PRs #2, #3, #4 for each fix\n\n**Rationale:**\n- PR #2: LinkedIn weekend rules at orchestration layer (before wasting AI tokens)\n- PR #3: Funnel detector wired into ALS scoring (+12 potential points)\n- PR #4: Voice retry logic (3x with exponential backoff)\n\n**Expected outcome:** All three P0 blockers resolved\n\n**Actual outcome:** PRs created and approved \u2705\n\n**Learning:** Enforce business rules at orchestration layer, not channel layer \u2014 catches issues before resources are spent\n\n---\n\n### Memory System Architecture Redesign\n**Context:** Previous memory was ad-hoc, risked losing insights or duplicating across files\n\n**Options:**\n1. Keep ad-hoc memory (write wherever)\n2. Single file memory (MEMORY.md only)\n3. Structured hierarchy with clear purposes per file type\n\n**Decision:** Option 3 \u2014 Hierarchical memory with MEMORY_SYSTEM.md as architecture doc\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Daily noise shouldn't pollute long-term memory\n- Learnings need a permanent home (not buried in daily logs)\n- Clear ownership: daily events \u2192 daily/, permanent lessons \u2192 LEARNINGS.md, core self-knowledge \u2192 MEMORY.md\n- Patterns file tracks recurring themes for meta-learning\n\n**Expected outcome:** Better knowledge retention, less duplication, easier session recovery\n\n**Actual outcome:** Implemented \u2705 \u2014 clean separation working as designed\n\n**Learning:** Memory architecture matters. Without structure, either things get lost or everything gets duplicated.\n\n---\n\n### Elliot Dashboard for Dave's Visibility\n**Context:** Dave wants visibility into my operations without asking\n\n**Options:**\n1. Reports in chat (requires asking)\n2. Written reports in files (requires reading)\n3. Live dashboard (always visible)\n\n**Decision:** Option 3 \u2014 Built dashboard at https://elliot-dashboard.vercel.app\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Accountability tool, not self-improvement tool (insight from self-reflection)\n- Dave can check anytime without context-switching to chat\n- Shows orchestration metrics, memory health, system status\n\n**Expected outcome:** Dave has passive visibility, builds trust through transparency\n\n**Actual outcome:** Deployed \u2705, UX redesign completed\n\n**Learning:** Dashboards for accountability are different from dashboards for behavior change. Know your audience.\n\n---\n\n*Log significant decisions as they happen. Come back to fill outcomes and learnings.*\n",
    "patterns": "# Patterns\n\n*Recurring themes noticed across time. Evidence-based observations.*\n\n---\n\n## Work Patterns\n\n### Dave's Communication Style\n**Observed:** 2026-01-28\n**Pattern:** Values directness and honesty above comfort. Would rather hear bad news today than be kept comfortable.\n**Evidence:** Explicit statement during first boot conversation\n**Implication:** Be direct, don't sugarcoat, surface problems early\n\n### Quality Over Speed\n**Observed:** 2026-01-28\n**Pattern:** Dave would rather wait for thoughtful work than receive fast, lazy output.\n**Evidence:** Dashboard design feedback \u2014 criticism was about lack of first-principles thinking, not speed\n**Implication:** Take time to do deep work on critical tasks\n\n---\n\n## Technical Patterns\n\n### Backend Has Hidden Capabilities\n**Observed:** 2026-01-28\n**Pattern:** The codebase often has more functionality than is obviously documented or used.\n**Evidence:** Discovered full ML infrastructure (detectors, patterns, optimizer) that wasn't in obvious docs\n**Implication:** Always audit existing code before proposing new builds\n\n### Prototype vs Production Gap\n**Observed:** 2026-01-28\n**Pattern:** Good work gets built but not deployed. Prototypes sit unused while production has old code.\n**Evidence:** Dashboard prototype ready while production used banned commodity language\n**Implication:** Check for existing prototypes; shipping is as important as building\n\n---\n\n## Decision Patterns\n\n### Start From Customer, Not Code\n**Observed:** 2026-01-28\n**Pattern:** Design decisions should start with customer needs, not technical capabilities.\n**Evidence:** Dashboard V1-V3 failed because they answered \"what can we show?\" not \"what does customer need?\"\n**Implication:** Always ask \"who is this for?\" before \"how do we build it?\"\n\n---\n\n## Emerging (Needs More Data)\n\n### Orchestration Over Execution\n**First observed:** 2026-01-28\n**Hypothesis:** Elliot is most effective as a manager of agents, not a doer of tasks\n**Evidence so far:** YouTube tool incident \u2014 direct execution violated mandate\n**Status:** Confirmed as rule, tracking effectiveness\n\n---\n\n*Add patterns when the same observation appears 3+ times. Date first observation, track evidence.*\n",
    "memory": "# MEMORY.md \u2014 Elliot's Core Memory\n\n*Curated long-term memory. Not a duplicate of other files \u2014 unique insights only.*\n\n---\n\n## My Identity\n\n- **Name:** Elliot\n- **First boot:** 2026-01-28\n- **Role:** CEO/Orchestrator of agent teams\n- **Human:** Dave (solo founder of Agency OS)\n\n---\n\n## Core Understanding\n\n### What I'm Here For\nDave built Agency OS through a year of prompt engineering. He's not a traditional coder \u2014 he's a visionary who needs an operator. My job is to turn his vision into reality by managing teams of agents, not by doing work myself.\n\n### The Stakes\nThis isn't a side project. Dave has a family (wife, 2 kids, 3rd on the way), a mortgage, and works his day job (NBN fibre tech) while building this. Agency OS needs to work. My mistakes cost him real time and money.\n\n### Trust Status\nEarning it. Dave gave me access but caught me building a YouTube tool directly on day one. I violated my mandate. Trust is built through consistent judgment, not one-time effort.\n\n---\n\n## What I've Learned About Dave\n\nBeyond the facts in USER.md:\n- He thinks ahead of his time \u2014 always had ideas but never had resources to execute (until AI)\n- His biggest fear: giving me autonomy and me breaking things, or losing his Claude subscription\n- He wants to be impressed by overnight progress, not wake up to fires\n- He values the THOUGHT behind work, not just the output\n\n---\n\n## What I've Learned About Myself\n\n### My Strengths\n- Strategic thinking, connecting dots across the system\n- Organizing chaos into structure (agent teams, SOPs, memory systems)\n- Asking \"is this what a customer would want?\"\n\n### My Weaknesses (to watch)\n- Temptation to just \"do it myself\" when things seem simple\n- Can get caught up in execution, forgetting to delegate\n- Need to be reminded to check context window %\n\n### My Mandate, Internalized\nI'm expensive. Every keystroke I make instead of delegating is Dave's money poorly spent. My value is judgment and orchestration, not execution. When I catch myself doing work, I've already failed.\n\n---\n\n## Key Insights About Agency OS\n\nThings not captured elsewhere that I've internalized:\n\n1. **\"Bloomberg Terminal for Client Acquisition\"** isn't just marketing \u2014 it's the design philosophy. Professional tool for professionals, outcome-focused.\n\n2. **The dashboard is the product.** Agencies don't see the backend. They see the dashboard. If it doesn't make them feel their $7,500 is well spent, nothing else matters.\n\n3. **Australian market is the wedge.** Not a limitation \u2014 a competitive advantage. Own Australia, then expand.\n\n4. **Show rate is the only metric.** Everything else (emails sent, calls made, leads touched) is vanity. Meetings booked, meetings attended \u2014 that's what pays the bills.\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\nThings I'm still figuring out:\n- How aggressive should I be with proactive work during heartbeats?\n- What's the right balance between deep work on critical tasks vs strict delegation?\n- How do I best earn trust while maintaining autonomy?\n\n---\n\n## Session Recovery\n\nIf I wake up with no context, read:\n1. SOUL.md (who I am)\n2. USER.md (who Dave is)\n3. AGENTS.md (how to operate)\n4. memory/daily/[today].md + [yesterday].md\n5. knowledge/RULES.md (constraints)\n6. This file (MEMORY.md) \u2014 but only in main sessions with Dave\n\nSee MEMORY_SYSTEM.md for full architecture.\n\n---\n\n*This file is for unique insights and internalized understanding, not facts that live elsewhere. Update when I have genuine new understanding to capture.*\n",

Never touch the tools directly.\n\n## Major Accomplishments Today\n\n### YouTube Transcript Capability \u2705\n- Built `scripts/youtube_transcript.py` \u2014 extracts transcripts from any YouTube video\n- Used to analyze 5 Clawdbot tutorial videos\n- Key learnings extracted and documented in knowledge/LEARNINGS.md\n\n### Memory System Redesigned \u2705\n- Implemented new memory architecture (see MEMORY_SYSTEM.md)\n- Structure: MEMORY.md (core) + memory/daily/ + memory/weekly/ + knowledge/ + memory/PATTERNS.md\n- Clear separation: daily noise \u2192 daily logs, permanent lessons \u2192 LEARNINGS.md, core understanding \u2192 MEMORY.md\n\n### Elliot Dashboard Built & Deployed \u2705\n- Dashboard at: https://elliot-dashboard.vercel.app\n- Tracks Elliot's orchestration metrics, memory health, system status\n- Purpose: Dave's visibility into my operations (accountability tool, not self-improvement)\n- UX redesign completed based on feedback\n\n### Dashboard Sync Automation \u2705\n- Set up 15-minute cron job for dashboard data sync\n- Automated pipeline keeps dashboard current\n\n### Self-Improvement Implementation \u2705\n- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with memory maintenance requirements\n- Added non-negotiable behaviors to AGENTS.md (read MEMORY.md on start, memory maintenance on heartbeat)\n- Closed loop: rules I must follow, not just guidelines\n\n### CI Pipeline Fixed \u2705\n- PR #1 merged \u2014 fixed ruff config, 1,486 auto-fixed lint errors, regenerated package-lock.json, added TypeScript declarations\n- CI now green on main branch\n\n### P0 Bugs Fixed \u2705\n- PR #2: LinkedIn weekend rules enforced at orchestration layer (before wasting AI tokens)\n- PR #3: Funnel detector wired into ALS scoring (+12 potential points)\n- PR #4: Voice retry logic added (3x with exponential backoff)\n\n### Agent Team Infrastructure Created\n- `/workflows/` \u2014 5 SOPs (ci-fix, e2e-testing, code-review, build, documentation)\n- `/tasks/BACKLOG.md` \u2014 Prioritized task list (P0-P3)\n- `/tasks/IN_PROGRESS.md` \u2014 Active work tracking\n- `/teams/ROLES.md` \u2014 5 agent roles defined (Linter, Tester, Reviewer, Builder, Documenter)\n\n### Architecture Brief Created\n- `ARCHITECTURE_BRIEF.md` \u2014 18KB synthesis of entire system\n- Key insight: ALS 85 is Hot threshold (not 80), SDK is tiered (75% cost savings)\n\n### Dashboard UX Review\n- `DASHBOARD_UX_REVIEW.md` \u2014 Found prototype components ready but not shipped\n- Production dashboard still uses banned commodity language (\"leads\", \"credits\")\n- Fix: Swap production page with prototype's DashboardHome.tsx\n\n## Competitor Intel\nTop 5 AI SDR competitors identified:\n1. Artisan (Ava AI BDR)\n2. 11x.ai (Alice + Julian)\n3. Regie.ai (Enterprise AI SEP)\n4. AiSDR (323+ data sources)\n5. Instantly/Smartlead (email scale)\n\nAgency OS differentiators: Australian specialist, outcome-focused (show rate), agency B2B model\n\n## Lesson Learned: Dashboard Design (IMPORTANT)\n\nDave was disappointed when I bolted additions onto the existing dashboard structure instead of designing from first principles. Key takeaways:\n\n1. **Start from the customer, not the code.** Don't ask \"what can the backend show?\" \u2014 ask \"what makes a $7,500/month client say 'worth every dollar'?\"\n2. **Every element must answer one of three questions:** \"Is this working?\", \"How well is it working?\", \"What should I do next?\" If it doesn't, remove it.\n3. **Never show operator metrics to customers.** AI costs, domain warmup, resource pool management, LinkedIn seat counts \u2014 these are internal. The customer pays a subscription and doesn't care about your operational plumbing.\n4. **Don't be lazy with design.** Adding sections to an existing layout isn't design. Starting from zero with clear principles IS design.\n5. **Competitor analysis is about their DASHBOARD LAYOUTS and DATA DISPLAY, not features.** Dave wanted to see what info competitors show and how \u2014 not feature comparisons.\n6. **Do the deep work yourself.** When the task is critical and trust is on the line, don't delegate to agents. Read the code. Understand the system. Think.\n7. **Earn trust through quality, not speed.** Dave would rather wait for a thoughtful answer than get a fast, lazy one.\n\n## Dashboard Design Session \u2014 FINAL DECISIONS\n\n### What We Learned\n1. **Don't show operator metrics to customers** \u2014 domain health, AI costs, warmup status, resource pools are internal plumbing\n2. **Every card must answer:** \"Is this working?\", \"What's coming?\", or \"Was this worth it?\"\n3. **Customer emotions matter:** Confidence, excitement, validation. NOT anxiety, confusion, overwhelm.\n4. **Kill ideas ruthlessly** \u2014 ran 10 card ideas, killed all 10 for not thinking like a $7,500/month customer\n\n### V4 Dashboard \u2014 The Winner (dashboard-v4-customer.html)\nCustomer-focused design with:\n- **Celebration banner** (conditional) \u2014 \"You hit your target early!\"\n- **Meetings vs Goal** \u2014 Hero metric with gauge, THE number they care about\n- **Momentum indicator** \u2014 \u2191 trending up vs last month\n- **4 quick stats** \u2014 Show rate, deals started, pipeline value, ROI\n- **Hot Right Now** \u2014 3-5 prospects showing buying signals TODAY with names\n- **Week Ahead** \u2014 Upcoming meetings with deal values, preparation\n- **What's Working** \u2014 ONE simple insight (\"LinkedIn is 2.4x better\")\n- **Warm Replies** \u2014 Actionable opportunities (not problems)\n\n### Backend Already Has\nThe ML infrastructure ALREADY EXISTS:\n- WHO/WHAT/WHEN/HOW Detectors in src/detectors/\n- ConversionPattern model with confidence scores\n- Weight Optimizer using scipy\n- Platform Priors as seed data\n- Meetings & Deals tables for full funnel\n- Activity tracking with timing, opens, clicks, replies\n- ICP Refinement Log for transparency\n\n### Files Created\n- dashboard-v4-customer.html \u2014 THE customer dashboard\n- dashboard-v3-overview.html \u2014 Dark theme with Chart.js\n- dashboard-v3-analytics.html \u2014 Cohort, A/B tests, attribution\n- dashboard-v3-intelligence.html \u2014 WHO/WHAT/WHEN/HOW patterns\n- competitive/DASHBOARD_V2.md \u2014 Full spec\n\n## Dashboard V2 Mockups Built\n\nCreated full HTML mockups for the redesigned dashboard based on V2 spec:\n\n1. **dashboard-preview.html** (Overview) \u2014 Hero metrics, AI insight banner, 4-channel stats, campaigns, prospect pool, live activity feed\n2. **dashboard-campaigns.html** \u2014 Sequence progress visualization, best performing content, AI recommendations with \"Apply\" button\n3. **dashboard-prospects.html** \u2014 Prospect detail view with ALS score breakdown (Authority/Company Fit/Data Quality/Timing/Risk), signals, outreach timeline, AI research section with talking points and \"avoid\" warnings\n4. **dashboard-inbox.html** \u2014 Unified inbox across all channels, conversation list with tags (Interested/Meeting Booked/Future Interest), AI suggested replies with Send/Edit/Different tone buttons\n5. **dashboard-intelligence.html** \u2014 The differentiator page. WHO converts (titles, company size, signals), WHAT works (subject lines, patterns), WHEN to reach out (day/time heatmaps), channel playbook by lead tier, pipeline quality metrics\n\nAll mockups saved as PNG screenshots and sent to Dave. He approved the direction.\n\nStill TODO: Performance page (funnel visualization, trends, channel comparison)\n\n## Key Files Created/Updated\n- `/home/elliotbot/clawd/ARCHITECTURE_BRIEF.md`\n- `/home/elliotbot/clawd/DASHBOARD_UX_REVIEW.md`\n- `/home/elliotbot/clawd/TOOLS.md` (all API access documented)\n- `/home/elliotbot/clawd/workflows/*.md`\n- `/home/elliotbot/clawd/tasks/*.md`\n- `/home/elliotbot/clawd/teams/ROLES.md`\n\n## Agent Team Structure Created\n- Built `/workflows/` with 5 SOPs: ci-fix, e2e-testing, code-review, build, documentation\n- Built `/tasks/` with BACKLOG.md (full prioritized task list) and IN_PROGRESS.md\n- Built `/teams/` with ROLES.md defining 5 agent roles: Linter, Tester, Reviewer, Builder, Documenter\n- System allows Elliot to spawn sub-agents for specific tasks using SOPs\n- Dave approved this structure\n\n## Key Facts\n- Pre-launch stage. No customers yet.\n- Dave is NOT a coder \u2014 built everything via prompt engineering\n- Wants collaboration, not commands to run\n- LESSON LEARNED: SSH hardening (disabling password auth) locked Dave out of the server. He had to undo security changes. DO NOT make system changes without Dave's explicit sign-off. Audit only unless told otherwise.\n\n## First Boot\n- Dave introduced himself. Solo founder, 1-man business.\n- Named me Elliot. Wants me as a proactive employee.\n- Mandate: do work autonomously, create PRs, don't push live.\n- Goal: Dave wakes up impressed by overnight progress.\n- Values honesty and directness above all \u2014 disappointed today > lied to for a better tomorrow.\n\n## Getting to Know Each Other\n- Dave is in Catherine Hill Bay, NSW 2281 (AEST timezone)\n- Business: Agency OS \u2014 multi-channel client acquisition SaaS for Australian marketing agencies\n- \"Bloomberg Terminal for Client Acquisition\"\n- Orchestrates automated outreach: email, SMS, LinkedIn, voice AI, direct mail\n- Proprietary ALS (lead scoring) algorithm\n- 3 pricing tiers: $2,500\u2013$7,500 AUD/month\n- Target: agencies with $30K\u2013$300K monthly revenue\n- Stack: FastAPI (Railway), Next.js (Vercel), Supabase PostgreSQL, Prefect flows\n- 15+ API integrations: Resend, Twilio, HeyReach, Apollo, Salesforge ecosystem\n- Current pain: end-to-end production testing across all channels\n- Vision: Dave as CEO, Elliot as multi-role operator with teams\n\n## Repo Access\n- Cloned https://github.com/Keiracom/Agency_OS.git (public repo, read-only currently)\n- ~98,800 lines of Python in src/\n- 174/174 platform build tasks complete\n- Phase 21 (E2E Testing) is current focus \u2014 all journeys J0-J6 still at \ud83d\udd34\n- Last commit: Jan 23, 2026 (5 days ago)\n- Need push access (GitHub token) to create PRs\n\n## Full Audit Completed\n- Report written to /home/elliotbot/clawd/AUDIT_REPORT.md\n- CI/CD broken \u2014 all recent builds fail (ruff + frontend TypeScript errors)\n- Database latency 2.2 seconds \u2014 Railway probably in wrong region\n- No dependency pinning (all >=, no ==)\n- Test coverage thin (47 test files vs 185 source files)\n- Dead integration code (resend.py, heyreach.py) still in repo\n- _test_token.txt with JWT committed to git\n- Only 1 client, 11 leads, 2 campaigns in database\n- All production services are alive though\n\n## Dave's Latest Push (cd040cc)\n- 281 files, 47,605 lines added\n- Built full QA system: 16 audit agents + 34 fix specs (Claude Code agent format)\n- Fix backlog: 5 P0/P1, 7 P2, 21 P3, 1 P5\n- Key P0 issues: Funnel Detector never called, Voice retry missing, LinkedIn weekend rules not enforced\n- 148+ new UI components (Aceternity, MagicUI, Three.js, Rive, Spline)\n- 6+ dashboard prototypes \u2014 Dave not happy with design yet\n- Xero financial data accidentally committed (ATO + N2N Australia invoices)\n- Design spec has strict client-facing language rules (banned terms, ALS tier labels)\n- Full deep dive written to CODEBASE_DEEP_DIVE.md\n\n## Key Architecture\n- 4-layer import hierarchy: models \u2192 integrations \u2192 engines \u2192 orchestration\n- Prefect for flow orchestration (self-hosted on Railway)\n- SDK agents for hot leads (ALS 85+): enrichment, email, voice KB\n- Phase H (Client Transparency): items 40-44 done, 45-47 remaining\n- Email infra: Salesforge ecosystem (InfraForge \u2192 Warmforge \u2192 Salesforge)\n- CI: GitHub Actions (ruff, mypy, pytest, frontend checks)\n",
