RECOMMENDATION,,,,,,,,,
"For Velocity tier pilot:",,,,,,,,
"1. Budget for COGS: $2,200-2,400/month (45-52% margin range)",,,,,,,,
"2. Target optimized: $2,158/month (56.8% margin)",,,,,,,,
"3. Track actual Claude token usage in month 1-2",,,,,,,,
"4. Implement prompt caching on ICP/industry context first (biggest win)",,,,,,,,
"5. Route classification tasks to Haiku immediately",,,,,,,,
