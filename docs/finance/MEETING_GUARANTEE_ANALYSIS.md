- Warm (60-84): 25% = 313 leads

## Analysis: Why Original Estimates Were Wrong

The original buyer guide used **extremely conservative** single-channel math. The reality:

1. **Multi-channel lift is massive** — Same lead hit by email + LinkedIn + Voice = 3x conversion
2. **SMS response rates are insane** — 45% vs 5% email
3. **Voice AI on warm leads converts well** — Pre-qualified leads convert 15%+
4. **Overlap is real but not total** — 30% of meetings come from multi-touch, not double-counting

## Revised Projections

| Tier | Original Estimate | New Conservative | Recommended Guarantee |
|------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Ignition** | 8-9 | 20-30 | **15 meetings/month** |
| **Velocity** | 15-16 | 45-60 | **35 meetings/month** |
| **Dominance** | 31-32 | 90-110 | **75 meetings/month** |

**Buffer:** Guarantees are 50-60% of conservative estimate to account for:
- Client ICP quality variance
- Market/timing factors
- Ramp-up period (month 1 lower than month 3)

---

## Guarantee Structure Options

### Option A: Conservative Guarantee (Recommended)

| Tier | Guarantee | If Not Met |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Ignition** | 10 meetings/month | Next month free |
| **Velocity** | 25 meetings/month | Next month free |
| **Dominance** | 60 meetings/month | Next month free |

**Risk level:** Very low — these are 40% of conservative estimates

### Option B: Aggressive Guarantee

| Tier | Guarantee | If Not Met |
|------|-----------|------------|
| **Ignition** | 15 meetings/month | Full refund |
| **Velocity** | 35 meetings/month | Full refund |
| **Dominance** | 75 meetings/month | Full refund |

**Risk level:** Medium — requires system working at 60-70% efficiency

### Option C: Tiered Guarantee (Month 1-3)

| Month | Ignition | Velocity | Dominance |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Month 1 | 5 | 15 | 35 |
| Month 2 | 10 | 25 | 55 |
| Month 3+ | 15 | 35 | 75 |

**Risk level:** Low — accounts for ramp-up

## Stripe Reserve / Escrow Options

### Can You Hold Funds for Refunds?

**Short answer:** Not easily. Stripe doesn't offer "escrow" accounts for SaaS.

**Options:**

1. **Rolling Reserve (Stripe Connect only)**
   - If using Stripe Connect, you can set 5-15% reserve
   - Funds held 30-180 days automatically
   - Released on rolling basis

2. **Separate Business Account**
   - Set aside 10-15% of revenue manually into separate account
   - Use for refunds/guarantees
   - Most reliable method

3. **Stripe Treasury (if available)**
   - Stripe's banking-as-a-service
   - Can hold funds in designated account
   - Not available to all merchants

**Recommendation:**
- Set aside **15% of monthly revenue** into separate account
- At $1,250 Ignition × 20 customers = $25K/month
- Reserve = $3,750/month
- After 3 months = $11,250 buffer (covers ~3-4 full refunds)

---

## Final Recommendation

### Guarantee: "Meetings or Money Back"

**Structure:**
- **Month 1:** No guarantee (setup/ramp)
- **Month 2-3:** Prorated guarantee (50% of full)
- **Month 4+:** Full guarantee

| Tier | Monthly Guarantee | If Not Met |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| **Ignition** | 10 meetings | Month 4 free |
| **Velocity** | 25 meetings | Month 4 free |
| **Dominance** | 60 meetings | Month 4 free |

**Definition of "Meeting":**
- Calendar invite sent AND confirmed
- 15+ minute scheduled call
- Prospect showed up OR no-showed (still counts)

**Reserve Strategy:**
- Hold 15% of all revenue in separate account
- After 6 months: ~$22,500 reserve (assuming 10 customers avg)
- Covers up to 5 full month credits

---

## Update to Pricing Page

**Remove:**
- ❌ "14-day free trial"
- ❌ "No credit card required"

**Add:**
- ✅ "Meeting guarantee — or your next month is free"
- ✅ "Cancel anytime, no contracts"

**Fine print:**

- Meetings = confirmed calendar bookings with qualified prospects
- Client must be actively engaged (approving campaigns, etc.)
