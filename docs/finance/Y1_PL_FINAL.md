### Why Engineer at M3?

Dave is non-technical. AI agents built the platform but cannot:
- Debug production issues at 2am
- Handle API changes from providers
- Make security judgment calls
- Respond to customer technical escalations
- Maintain system health proactively

**Engineer is the #1 critical hire.**
