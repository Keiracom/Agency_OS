# What Agency OS Actually Delivers

**For agency owners doing the math on whether this is worth it.**

---

## The Bottom Line (Skip to the End)

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Meetings You'll Get | Clients You'll Close |
|------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Ignition** | $2,500 | 8-9 | 1-2 |
| **Velocity** | $4,000 | 15-16 | 3-4 |
| **Dominance** | $7,500 | 31-32 | 9-10 |

**At typical agency retainers ($3-5K/month):**
- **Ignition** breaks even on 1 client
- **Velocity** breaks even on 1-2 clients  
- **Dominance** breaks even on 2-3 clients

**You'll close 1-2 clients on Ignition, 3-4 on Velocity, 9-10 on Dominance. Even at conservative client values, you're 2-3x profitable from month one.**

---

## How We Get There (The Math)

### Step 1: We Find Leads That Match Your ICP

You give us your website. We extract who you actually serve — industries, company sizes, titles, pain points.

| Plan | Leads/Month | After Enrichment | Workable Leads |
|------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Ignition | 1,250 | 844 | 760 |
| Velocity | 2,250 | 1,519 | 1,367 |
| Dominance | 4,500 | 3,038 | 2,734 |

Not all leads are equal. That's why we score them.

---

### Step 2: We Score and Prioritise (The YES Score)

Every lead gets a score from 0-100 based on:
- **Data quality** — Do we have verified email, phone, LinkedIn?
- **Authority** — Are they the decision maker?
- **Company fit** — Right size, right industry, right location?
- **Timing** — New in role? Company hiring? Recently funded?
- **Risk** — Any red flags?

| Score | Label | What Happens |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 85-100 | 🔥 Hot | All 5 channels — Email, SMS, LinkedIn, Voice, Direct Mail |
| 60-84 | 🟠 Warm | Email + LinkedIn + Voice calls |
| 35-59 | 🟡 Cool | Email + LinkedIn |
| 20-34 | 🔵 Cold | Email only |
| 0-19 | ⬛ Dead | Suppressed (don't waste your time) |

**The insight:** Hot + Warm leads are only 30% of your pool, but they drive 65% of your meetings.

That's why scoring matters more than volume.

---

### Step 3: We Run Multi-Channel Outreach

Here's what each channel actually does:

| Channel | Who Gets It | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Email** | Everyone | Opens doors, nurtures over time |
| **LinkedIn** | Cool+ | Professional touch, builds credibility |
| **Voice AI** | Warm+ | Cuts through noise, books directly |
| **SMS** | Hot only | High urgency, high response |
| **Direct Mail** | Hot only | Pattern interrupt, memorable |

**Why multi-channel matters:**

| Approach | Meetings (Ignition) |
|----------|---------------------|
| Email only | 4 |
| Email + LinkedIn | 6 |
| Email + LinkedIn + Voice | 7 |
| **All 5 channels** | **8-9** |

You're leaving half your meetings on the table if you're email-only.

---

### Step 4: Responses Convert to Meetings

Not everyone who replies books a meeting. We're conservative here:

| Stage | Conversion |
|-------|------------|
| Positive reply → Meeting booked | 50% |
| Meeting booked → Meeting happens | 75% |
| **Net: Positive reply → Actual meeting** | **37.5%** |

---

## Your Expected Results

### Ignition ($2,500/month)

```
1,250 leads
  → 760 workable (scored 20+)
    → 23 positive responses (across all channels)
      → 8-9 meetings booked
        → 1-2 new clients (at 20% close rate)
```

**ROI:** At $3,000/client average, you're making $3-6K from a $2,500 investment. **Profitable from client one.**

---

### Velocity ($4,000/month)

```
2,250 leads
  → 1,367 workable
    → 42 positive responses
      → 15-16 meetings booked
        → 3-4 new clients (at 25% close rate)
```

**ROI:** At $4,000/client, you're making $12-16K from $4,000 spend. **3-4x return.**

---

### Dominance ($7,500/month)

```
4,500 leads
  → 2,734 workable
    → 84 positive responses
      → 31-32 meetings booked
        → 9-10 new clients (at 30% close rate)
```

**ROI:** At $6,000/client, you're making $54-60K from $7,500 spend. **7-8x return.**

## The Real Comparison: Agency OS vs Hiring a Junior SDR

Let's be honest about what hiring looks like.

### What Does a Junior SDR Actually Cost?

| Cost Component | Annual (AUD) | Monthly (AUD) | Source |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Base salary | $50,000-60,000 | $4,167-5,000 | PayScale, SEEK Australia |
| Superannuation (11.5%) | $5,750-6,900 | $479-575 | ATO requirement |
| Commission/bonus (OTE) | $15,000-25,000 | $1,250-2,083 | Industry standard 70/30 split |
| Tools (Apollo, Lemlist, etc.) | $3,600-6,000 | $300-500 | Platform pricing |
| Training & onboarding | $2,000-5,000 | — | One-time |
| Management overhead | 5-10 hrs/week of your time | $2,000-4,000* | Your opportunity cost |
| **Total Year 1** | **$78,000-105,000** | **$6,500-8,750** | |

*Assuming your time is worth $100/hr

### What Does a Junior SDR Actually Do All Day?

Based on industry benchmarks, here's a typical junior SDR's workflow:

| Activity | Hours/Day | Weekly Hours | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Cold calling | 2.5-3.5 hrs | 15-20 hrs | ZoomInfo, SalesHive |
| Email outreach + personalization | 1.5-2 hrs | 8-10 hrs | Salesloft benchmark |
| LinkedIn prospecting | 0.5-1 hr | 3-5 hrs | HeyReach data |
| Research & list building | 1-2 hrs | 5-10 hrs | Bridge Group |
| Admin, CRM updates, meetings | 1-2 hrs | 5-10 hrs | Industry average |
| **Total productive selling time** | **2-3 hrs** | **10-15 hrs** | SalesHive 2024 |

**Key insight:** SDRs spend only ~2-3 hours per day actually selling. The rest is research, admin, and tool management.

> Source: SalesHive 2024 — "On average, SDRs spend only about 2 hours per day actively selling"

---

### What Are Their KPIs?

| Metric | Junior SDR Benchmark | Source |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Calls per day | 40-80 | Bridge Group, ZoomInfo |
| Emails per day | 40-60 | Bridge Group |
| LinkedIn touches/day | 10-20 | HeyReach |
| Connect rate (calls) | 5-8% | Gong.io |
| Email reply rate | 1-5% | Lemlist |
| **Meetings booked/month** | **10-15** | Bridge Group, Crunchbase |
| Quota attainment | 65-68% | RepVue, Bridge Group |

> Sources: Bridge Group SDR Metrics Report 2024, Crunchbase SDR KPIs 2024, RepVue Australia data

**Reality check:** The *average* SDR books 10-15 meetings/month. But only 65-68% hit quota. That means many are booking 6-10.

---

### The Hidden Costs Nobody Tells You About

| Hidden Factor | Impact | Source |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Ramp time** | 3-4 months to full productivity | Bridge Group (3.2 months average) |
| **Average tenure** | 1.8 years (then they leave) | Bridge Group 2024 |
| **Quota attainment** | Only 65-68% of SDRs hit quota | RepVue, Bridge Group |
| **Sick days/leave** | 10-15 days/year minimum | Australian employment law |
| **Management drain** | 5-10 hrs/week of *your* time | Industry estimate |
| **Turnover cost** | $15-25K per replacement | HR industry benchmark |

**What this means:**
- Month 1-3: Training. Zero meetings.
- Month 4-6: Ramping. Maybe 5-8 meetings/month.
- Month 7-18: Productive. 10-15 meetings/month (if they hit quota).
- Month 19+: They leave. Start over.

> Source: Bridge Group 2024 — "Average ramp time is 3.1-3.2 months and average tenure is only 1.8 years, so you get ~17 months of full productivity"

---

### The Workflow Problem: Seniors Feeding Juniors

In most agencies, here's how it actually works:

```
Senior/Founder spends 2-3 hrs/week:
  → Defining target accounts
  → Building lead lists
  → Writing email sequences
  → Reviewing call recordings
  → Coaching on objections
  → Approving LinkedIn messages

Junior SDR then:
  → Executes the sequences
  → Makes the calls
  → Sends the emails
  → Updates the CRM
  → Reports back on results
```

**The problem:** You're not just paying for the junior. You're paying with your own time to make them effective.

> Source: Tito Bohrt (LinkedIn) — "Having to spend 1-3 hours a day on research just to find contacts is a huge waste of time... SDRs cost $100K/yr to an organization, which is about $50/hr. Organizations are throwing money away by having their SDRs work as data entry employees."

### Head-to-Head: Junior SDR vs Agency OS

| Factor | Junior SDR | Agency OS Velocity |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Monthly cost** | $6,500-8,750 | $4,000 |
| **Meetings/month (realistic)** | 8-12 (after ramp) | 15-16 |
| **Time to first meeting** | 3-4 months | Day 1 |
| **Your time required** | 5-10 hrs/week | <1 hr/week |
| **Sick days** | Yes | No |
| **Annual leave** | 4 weeks | No |
| **Turnover risk** | High (1.8yr tenure) | None |
| **Channels covered** | 2-3 (manual) | 5 (automated) |
| **Voice calls** | Manual (limited) | AI (unlimited) |
| **Works weekends** | No | Yes |
| **Scales instantly** | No (hire more) | Yes (upgrade tier) |

---

### Cost Per Meeting Comparison

| Option | Monthly Cost | Meetings | Cost/Meeting |
|--------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **Junior SDR (ramped)** | $6,500-8,750 | 8-12 | **$600-900** |
| **Agency OS Ignition** | $2,500 | 8-9 | **$312** |
| **Agency OS Velocity** | $4,000 | 15-16 | **$267** |
| **Agency OS Dominance** | $7,500 | 31-32 | **$242** |

**Agency OS delivers meetings at 30-50% of the cost of a junior SDR.**

| Ramp time | 3-4 months | Instant | **3-4 months faster** |

---

## "What If I'm Not Great at Closing?"

Fair question. Here's what happens if things go wrong:

### Scenario: You're Busy and Drop the Ball (-35% performance)

| Plan | Normal Meetings | You at -35% | Clients | Still Worth It? |
|------|-----------------|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| Ignition | 8 | 5 | 1 | ⚠️ Barely |
| Velocity | 15 | 10 | 2-3 | ✅ Yes |
| Dominance | 31 | 20 | 6 | ✅ Definitely |

**Velocity and Dominance are profitable even when you're having a bad month.**

Ignition is tighter — if you're time-poor, consider Velocity for the buffer.

---

## "What If I Don't Have Time to Manage This?"

Good news: Agency OS handles most of the work.

| Task | Junior SDR | Agency OS |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Finding leads | You define, they research | ✅ Automated |
| Enriching data | They use tools manually | ✅ Automated |
| Scoring leads | You create criteria, they tag | ✅ AI-powered |
| Writing emails | You write, they tweak | ✅ AI-generated |
| Sending emails | They send manually | ✅ Automated |
| LinkedIn outreach | They do manually | ✅ Automated |
| Voice calls | They call (limited hours) | ✅ AI Voice (unlimited) |
| SMS | Usually don't | ✅ Automated |
| Direct mail | Usually don't | ✅ Automated |
| CRM updates | They update manually | ✅ Automated |
| Reporting | They compile weekly | ✅ Real-time dashboard |
| **Showing up to meetings** | You | 👈 **You** |
| **Closing the deal** | You | 👈 **You** |

**You need to show up and close. Everything else runs on autopilot.**

---

## "How Does This Compare to What I'm Doing Now?"

### If You're Using Apollo + Lemlist + Manual LinkedIn:

| What You're Doing | Cost | Meetings/Month |
|-------------------|------|----------------|
| Apollo subscription | $99 | — |
| Lemlist | $99 | — |
| LinkedIn Sales Nav | $100 | — |
| Your time (20 hrs @ $100/hr) | $2,000 | — |
| **Total** | **$2,298** | **3-5 meetings** |

| Agency OS Ignition | $2,500 | **8-9 meetings** |

**Same cost, 2x the meetings, and you get your 20 hours back.**

---

### If You're Paying an Outsourced SDR Service:

| What You're Doing | Cost | Meetings/Month |
|-------------------|------|----------------|
| Outsourced SDR (offshore) | $3,000-5,000 | 8-12 |
| Tools + management | $500-1,000 | — |
| **Total** | **$3,500-6,000** | **8-12 meetings** |

| Agency OS Velocity | $4,000 | **15-16 meetings** |

**Similar cost, 30-50% more meetings, no quality variance.**

---

## Choosing the Right Plan

| You're a... | Recommended | Why |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Solo founder, $30-50K MRR | **Ignition** | Enough to grow, won't break the bank |
| Small team, $50-100K MRR | **Velocity** | Buffer for busy months, room to scale |
| Established agency, $100K+ MRR | **Dominance** | Maximum pipeline, best economics |

---

|------|----------------------|
| Ignition ($2,500) | 1 client @ $2,500+ |
| Velocity ($4,000) | 1-2 clients @ $2,000-4,000 |
| Dominance ($7,500) | 2-3 clients @ $2,500-3,750 |
