## Part 2: Personalized Email Samples (5 Real AU Agencies)

### Agency 1: Impressive Digital (Melbourne)

**Background Research:**
- 50+ employees, fast-growing SEO/PPC agency
- Named in AFR Fast 100
- CEO: Robert Tadros
- Recent: Expanded to Sydney office

```
Subject: Impressive's Sydney expansion + AI

Robert,

Congrats on the Sydney office — saw the AFR coverage. Growing from 
Melbourne to a second city is no small feat, especially while maintaining 
the SEO results Impressive is known for.

Quick thought: as you scale to two locations, how are you thinking about 
lead gen? Most agencies I talk to hit a wall where the founder can't 
personally do all the BD anymore.

We built Agency OS specifically for AU agencies scaling past that founder-led 
sales stage. It's AI that finds, qualifies, and books meetings across 5 
channels — so your team can focus on delivering those 10x ROAS results.

Worth a 15-min look? Happy to show you how a few agencies similar size to 
Impressive are using it.

— Dave
Founder, Agency OS

PS - We're Australia-only, ACMA compliant, and I'm based in Newcastle. 
No US playbook here.
```

### Agency 2: Spicy Web (Brisbane)

**Background Research:**
- Boutique Shopify agency
- Strong focus on e-commerce
- Founders: Wade & Sam
- Recent: Published "Shopify Success" case study series

```
Subject: Shopify case studies → more Shopify clients?

Wade,

Just read through your Shopify Success series — the breakdown on 
headless commerce for that home goods brand was sharp. Clear thinking, 
no jargon. Rare.

It got me wondering: with content that good, what's your process for 
getting it in front of e-commerce brands who should see it?

We built Agency OS to solve exactly that. It's AI-powered outreach across 
email, LinkedIn, and even direct mail that finds brands who match your 
ICP and books discovery calls.

One agency we work with went from 2 inbound leads/month to 8 qualified 
demos/month by just automating their case study distribution.

Would you be open to a 15-min call to see if it'd work for Spicy Web?

— Dave
Founder, Agency OS

### Agency 3: The Royals (Melbourne)

**Background Research:**
- Creative agency, 40+ team
- B Corp certified
- High-profile clients: Treasury Wine Estates, ANZ
- Strong brand purpose focus

```
Subject: Purpose-driven growth at The Royals

Michael,

The B Corp certification while maintaining clients like Treasury and ANZ 
is impressive — proves purpose and profit aren't mutually exclusive.

Here's what I'm curious about: how does an agency with your brand values 
approach new business? Traditional cold outreach feels misaligned with 
purpose-driven work.

That's exactly why we built Agency OS. It's not about spam volume — it's 
AI that researches each prospect, personalizes every touch, and only 
reaches out to companies that genuinely match your values and capabilities.

Think of it as curation at scale. Your voice, your values, just amplified.

I'd love to show you how it could work for The Royals. 15 minutes?

— Dave
Founder, Agency OS

PS - ACMA compliant, Australia-first. We're not one of those US tools 
pretending to understand our market.
```

### Agency 4: Klyp (Melbourne)

**Background Research:**
- Full-service digital agency
- Strong in WordPress/WooCommerce
- Co-founders: Chris & Joel
- Recent: Launched new service line in Shopify migration

```
Subject: Klyp's Shopify migration play

Chris,

The Shopify migration service launch caught my eye — smart move with 
the market shift from legacy platforms. Timing feels right.

How are you planning to get in front of merchants who are frustrated 
with their current WooCommerce or Magento setups but don't know 
migration is an option?

We built Agency OS specifically for this use case. It's AI that 
identifies businesses showing "platform pain" signals — slow sites, 
bad reviews mentioning tech issues, outdated stack mentions on their 
LinkedIn — then reaches out with personalized messaging.

One agency we piloted with is booking 3-4 migration consults per 
week now. All outbound.

Worth a quick chat to see if it fits Klyp's plans?

— Dave
Founder, Agency OS
```

### Agency 5: Web Profits (Sydney)

**Background Research:**  
- Growth-focused digital agency
- Strong in Facebook/Google Ads
- Founder: Sujan Patel (connected to US growth community)
- Known for data-driven approach

```
Subject: Web Profits + AI-powered pipeline

Alex,

Web Profits' data-driven approach to performance marketing is what 
got you on my radar. You measure everything for clients — bet you'd 
appreciate a similar approach to pipeline.

Quick context: We're launching Agency OS, an AI system that applies 
the same data-rigor to new business. It scores every lead 0-100 based 
on 47 signals before any outreach, so you only spend time on 
high-probability prospects.

Think of it as LTV:CAC optimization, but for your sales process.

Given your focus on measurable growth, I thought you'd either find 
this interesting or tell me exactly why it won't work. Either way, 
I learn.

15 minutes?

— Dave
Founder, Agency OS

PS - We're looking for 20 founding agencies and giving 50% off for 
life. Happy to share the math on expected pipeline ROI.
```

## Part 3: Reply Handling Playbook

### Response Category: INTERESTED ✅

**Signals:**
- "This looks interesting"
- "Tell me more"
- "Can we book a call?"
- "What's the pricing?"
- "How does it work?"

**Response Template:**

```
Subject: Re: {{original subject}}

{{first_name}},

Great to hear from you! Happy to dive deeper.

The quickest way to show you how Agency OS works is a 15-minute call. 
I'll walk you through exactly how the AI finds, qualifies, and reaches 
prospects — tailored to {{company}}'s specific situation.

Here's my calendar: [Calendly link]

If you'd prefer, I can send over a 3-minute video demo first. Just 
let me know.

Looking forward to it.

— Dave
```

**If they ask about pricing before demo:**

```
Subject: Re: {{original subject}}

{{first_name}},

Good question. Here's the straightforward answer:

Founding member pricing (limited to 20 agencies):
• Ignition: $1,250/mo (normally $2,500) — 1,250 leads, 3 channels
• Acceleration: $2,500/mo (normally $5,000) — 3,000 leads, 5 channels
• Domination: $3,750/mo (normally $7,500) — 5,000 leads, 5 channels + dedicated CSM

That 50% discount is locked for life — your price never goes up.

Most agencies see ROI within the first month. One signed retainer 
typically covers 4-6 months of the platform.

Worth a quick call to see which tier fits {{company}}?

### Response Category: NOT NOW ⏰

**Signals:**
- "Timing isn't right"
- "Try me in Q3"
- "Busy with a big project"
- "Maybe later"
- "Not a priority right now"

**Response Template:**

```
Subject: Re: {{original subject}}

{{first_name}},

Totally understand — timing is everything.

I'll set a reminder to check back in {{their timeframe or 3 months}}. 
In the meantime, I'll remove you from our sequence so you're not 
getting more emails.

If anything changes on your end, just reply to this thread. 
I'm here.

All the best with {{specific project if mentioned}}.

— Dave
```

**CRM Action:**
- Tag: `nurture:not-now`
- Set reminder: Date mentioned or 90 days
- Remove from active sequence
- Add to monthly newsletter (if opted in)

---

### Response Category: UNSUBSCRIBE 🛑

**Signals:**
- "Remove me"
- "Unsubscribe"
- "Stop emailing me"
- "Not interested, don't contact again"

**Response Template:**

```
Subject: Re: {{original subject}}

{{first_name}},

Done — you're removed from all our lists. No more emails from us.

If you ever change your mind, happy to chat. But I'll respect 
your inbox until then.

Cheers,
Dave
```

**CRM Action:**
- Tag: `unsubscribed`
- Add to suppression list (email + domain if company-wide)
- Remove from all sequences
- Block from future imports
- Log for ACMA compliance

**⚠️ Critical:** NEVER re-add an unsubscribed contact. This is both a legal and relationship issue.

### Response Category: OBJECTIONS 🤔

#### Objection 1: "AI outreach is spammy"

```
Subject: Re: {{original subject}}

{{first_name}},

Valid concern — and honestly, most AI outreach tools ARE spammy. 
That's exactly why we built Agency OS differently.

Here's what we do:
1. AI researches each prospect individually (LinkedIn, company 
   news, recent work)
2. Generates personalized messaging that references specific 
   things about their business
3. Limits volume to maintain quality (we cap at 300/day, not 3,000)
4. Measures show rate, not send rate — we only succeed when 
   you get real meetings

The goal is "thoughtful at scale," not "spam at scale."

Happy to show you actual examples of personalized outreach 
we've generated. 15 minutes?

— Dave
```

#### Objection 2: "We've tried automation before, it didn't work"

```
Subject: Re: {{original subject}}

{{first_name}},

Been there. Most automation tools fail because they're just 
mail merge with a scheduling layer.

Agency OS is different:
- AI writes genuinely personalized messages (not {{first_name}} 
  with a template)
- Multi-channel coordination (email → LinkedIn → SMS → voice → 
  direct mail)
- Lead scoring that prevents wasting time on bad-fit prospects
- Show rate tracking, not vanity metrics

The agencies that failed with Mailchimp sequences or basic 
LinkedIn automation are often our best customers — because they 
understand what DOESN'T work.

Worth seeing if this is actually different? 15 min, no pressure.

— Dave
```

#### Objection 3: "It's too expensive"

```
Subject: Re: {{original subject}}

{{first_name}},

Appreciate the honesty. Let me break down the math:

Founding tier: $1,250/mo (Ignition)

What that gets you:
- 1,250 enriched leads/month
- AI-powered outreach across 3 channels
- Expected output: 8-15 qualified demos/month

If just ONE of those demos converts to a $3K/mo retainer client, 
you've paid for 2.4 months of Agency OS.

Compare to hiring a BDM:
- Salary: $70-90K + super + management time
- Ramp time: 3-6 months before they're effective

Agency OS is productive on Day 1.

If the ROI math doesn't work for {{company}}'s deal size, I'll 
tell you. But usually it works out heavily in your favor.

Worth a quick call to run the numbers for your specific situation?

— Dave
```

#### Objection 4: "How is this different from Apollo/Instantly/etc?"

```
Subject: Re: {{original subject}}

{{first_name}},

Good question — here's the honest breakdown:

**Apollo:** Great for data. But it's still you writing sequences 
and manually coordinating channels. It's a tool, not an employee.

**Instantly:** Email only. No LinkedIn, no SMS, no voice. Works 
for volume plays, not agency-style relationship building.

**Agency OS:**
- True AI that writes personalized messages (not templates)
- 5-channel orchestration (coordinates the whole journey)
- Lead scoring so you only talk to hot prospects
- Built for Australian agencies (ACMA compliant, AU data, local 
  voice numbers)
- We measure booked meetings, not emails sent

Think of Apollo as the database, Instantly as the delivery truck, 
and Agency OS as the full employee who thinks, coordinates, and 
books meetings.

If you're already using Apollo or Instantly, Agency OS can work 
alongside them — we can even use their data.

Want me to show you the difference in a 15-min call?

— Dave
```

#### Objection 5: "I need to discuss with my team/partner"

```
Subject: Re: {{original subject}}

{{first_name}},

Totally makes sense. Do you want me to send over a quick summary 
doc you can share with them? Includes:

- 2-minute video overview
- Pricing breakdown
- Case study from a similar agency
- ROI calculator

That way they have context before you all chat.

I can also jump on a quick call with whoever the decision-maker 
is — happy to answer their specific questions.

What works best?

— Dave
```

### A. Demo Confirmation Email

```
Subject: Your Agency OS Demo — {{date}} at {{time}}

{{first_name}},

Looking forward to our chat! Here's what to expect:

📅 **When:** {{date}} at {{time}} AEST
📍 **Where:** [Zoom link]
⏱️ **Duration:** 15 minutes

**What we'll cover:**
1. Your current outreach process (2 min)
2. Quick demo of Agency OS (8 min)
3. Founding member offer (2 min)
4. Q&A (3 min)

**One thing to think about:**
What would 10 extra qualified demos per month mean for {{company}}?

See you then.

— Dave
Founder, Agency OS

P.S. — If something comes up, you can reschedule here: [link]
```

### B. No-Show Follow-Up

```
Subject: Missed you earlier — should we reschedule?

{{first_name}},

Tried to connect for our demo at {{time}} but you weren't able to 
make it. No worries — things happen.

Two options:
1. Reschedule: [Calendly link]
2. I can send a 3-min video walkthrough instead

Either works for me. What's easier?

— Dave
```

### C. Post-Demo Follow-Up (Interested)

```
Subject: As promised — Agency OS next steps

{{first_name}},

Great chatting today. As discussed:

**What you're getting (Founding Member — Ignition tier):**
- 1,250 enriched leads/month
- AI-powered outreach across email, LinkedIn, and SMS
- Lead scoring (ALS) on all prospects
- Direct Slack channel with me
- 50% off for life ($1,250/mo locked)

**Next steps:**
1. I'll send the contract via DocuSign (takes 2 min to sign)
2. We'll schedule your onboarding call for this week
3. You're live within 48 hours

Questions before I send the contract?

— Dave

P.S. — Only {{spots_remaining}} founding spots left. Not using 
scarcity as a tactic — just the truth.
