## Part 1: Market Analysis

### Target Market

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Geography | Australia (NSW, VIC, QLD priority) |
| Industry | Marketing/Digital Agencies |
| Size | 5-50 employees |
| Revenue | $500K - $10M AUD |
| Decision Maker | Founder, Managing Director, Growth Lead |
| TAM | ~12,000 agencies nationwide |
| SAM | ~3,000 (right size, right intent) |
| SOM (Year 1) | 100 customers |

### Buyer Personas

#### Persona 1: The Overwhelmed Founder
- **Name:** "Busy Ben"
- **Role:** Agency Founder/Owner
- **Pain:** Spends 60% of time on business development instead of client work
- **Fear:** Feast/famine revenue cycles
- **Goal:** Predictable pipeline without hiring salespeople
- **Objection:** "I've tried automation before, it didn't work"
- **Trigger:** Lost a big pitch, slow quarter, competitor growing faster

#### Persona 2: The Growth-Hungry Director
- **Name:** "Scaling Sarah"
- **Role:** Managing Director / Growth Lead
- **Pain:** Can't scale outreach without burning out team
- **Fear:** Hiring salespeople is expensive and risky
- **Goal:** 10x outreach volume with same headcount
- **Objection:** "AI outreach is spammy and damages brand"
- **Trigger:** Board pressure, funding milestone, expansion plans

#### Persona 3: The Tech-Forward Innovator
- **Name:** "AI Andy"
- **Role:** Agency Owner (early adopter)
- **Pain:** Knows AI is the future, can't find right tool
- **Fear:** Falling behind competitors using AI
- **Goal:** Competitive advantage through automation
- **Objection:** "Is this actually different from what I've tried?"
- **Trigger:** Saw competitor using AI, read about Artisan/11x

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | Price | Weakness |
|------------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Artisan (Ava) | AI SDR, US-focused | $5,000+/mo | Not Australia-native, expensive |
| 11x (Alice) | AI workers | $4,000+/mo | Generic B2B, not agency-specific |
| Apollo | Data + sequences | $99-499/mo | Not AI-native, just data |
| Instantly | Cold email | $37-97/mo | Email only, no multi-channel |
| HeyReach | LinkedIn automation | $79/mo | Single channel, no intelligence |
| Reply.io | Multichannel outreach | $60-90/mo | Not AI-native, manual setup |

### Our Positioning

> **Agency OS is the AI-powered growth operating system built exclusively for Australian marketing agencies.**

**Category:** Not "AI SDR" — We're creating "Agency Growth OS"

**Differentiators:**
1. **Australia-first:** ACMA compliant, AU data, local numbers
2. **Agency-specific:** ICP extraction designed for agencies
3. **True multi-channel:** Email + LinkedIn + SMS + Voice + Direct Mail
4. **AI-native:** Not automation with AI bolted on — AI at the core
5. **Outcome-focused:** We measure show rate, not emails sent

|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| LinkedIn (Organic) | Thought leadership, Dave as founder | P0 | 0% (time only) |
| LinkedIn (Outbound) | Direct outreach via Unipile | P0 | 10% |
| Cold Email | Primary outreach channel | P0 | 20% |

### Channel Details

#### LinkedIn (Organic) — Dave as Founder

**Goal:** Position Dave as thought leader in AI + agency growth

**Content Pillars:**
1. Behind-the-scenes of building Agency OS with AI
2. Australian agency market insights
3. AI/automation tips for agencies
4. Customer stories and wins

**Posting Cadence:**
- 3x per week (Mon, Wed, Fri)
- 1 long-form article per month
- 1 video per week (even if just talking head)

**Sample Posts:**

*Post 1: Launch Announcement*
> 🚀 After 18 months of building in the margins (while working as an NBN tech with 2 kids and another on the way), I'm launching Agency OS.
>
> It's an AI-powered growth platform built exclusively for Australian marketing agencies.
>
> Why Australia-only? Because I'm tired of US tools that don't understand ACMA, don't have AU phone numbers, and think "local" means California.
>
> Looking for 20 founding agencies to help shape the product.
> 
> 50% off for life. Serious inquiries only.
>
> Comment "FOUNDING" if you want details.

*Post 2: Building with AI*
> I'm not a developer. I can't write Python.
>
> But I've built a full SaaS product with 15 API integrations, AI-powered lead scoring, and multi-channel automation.
>
> How? Claude, Cursor, and 18 months of obsessive learning.
>
> The barrier to entry for software is gone. The barrier is now WILL.
>
> Who else is building without a technical background?

*Post 3: Dogfooding*
> We just ran our first campaign using Agency OS to sell Agency OS.
>
> 500 leads enriched → 42 ALS score 85+ → 200 emails sent → 18 replies → 6 demos booked.
>
> That's a 3% demo rate from cold outreach.
>
> And the AI did 95% of the work.
>
> Here's exactly how we did it: [link to blog post]

#### Cold Email — Primary Outreach

**Strategy:** Dogfood Agency OS to run cold email campaigns

**Volume:** 
- Week 1-2: 100 emails/day (warm up)
- Week 3+: 300 emails/day

**Sequence Structure:**

*Email 1: The Hook (Day 1)*
```
Subject: {{company}} + AI outreach?

{{first_name}},

I looked at {{company}} — impressive work on [specific recent project from LinkedIn/website].

Quick question: how much of your time goes into finding new clients vs. doing great work for them?

We built Agency OS specifically for AU agencies like yours. It's AI that finds, qualifies, and books meetings across 5 channels.

Worth a 15-min chat? I can show you exactly how it works.

— Dave
Founder, Agency OS
```

*Email 2: Value Add (Day 3)*
```
Subject: Re: {{company}} + AI outreach?

{{first_name}},

Didn't mean to add to your inbox noise.

Thought you might find this useful: We wrote up how we use AI to score leads before spending any time on them.

[Link: The 47 Signals That Predict Which Leads Will Buy]

If you're curious how we'd score leads for {{company}}, happy to run a free analysis.

— Dave
```

*Email 3: Social Proof (Day 7)*
```
Subject: How [Similar Agency] Booked 12 Meetings Last Month

{{first_name}},

Quick case study I thought you'd appreciate:

[Similar Agency] was spending 20 hrs/week on outreach. After switching to Agency OS:
- 12 qualified meetings booked
- 15 hours/week saved
- 2 new retainer clients

Their founder said: "It's like having a full-time BDM who never takes a sick day."

Want to see if we can get similar results for {{company}}?

[Book 15-Min Call]

— Dave
```

*Email 4: Breakup (Day 14)*
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

{{first_name}},

I'll assume the timing isn't right.

If you ever want to explore AI-powered outreach for {{company}}, I'm here.

Removing you from our sequence — no more emails from me.

All the best,
Dave

PS — If you know another agency owner who'd benefit, happy to offer them the same founding member deal.
```

#### Voice AI — High-Value Conversion

**Purpose:** Call leads with ALS 90+ who haven't responded to email

**Script Framework:**

```
MAYA: "Hi, is this {{first_name}}? 
       Great — this is Maya calling from Agency OS. 
       I wanted to follow up on an email Dave sent about AI-powered outreach for agencies. 
       Is now a good time for a quick 2-minute chat?"

IF YES:
MAYA: "Perfect. I noticed {{company}} has been growing — congrats on [recent win/news]. 
       Dave thought you might be interested in how some agencies are using AI to book meetings 
       without spending hours on cold outreach. 
       Would it be helpful if I sent over a case study, or would you prefer a quick 15-minute demo with Dave?"

IF DEMO:
MAYA: "Great! I can see Dave has availability [time slots]. Which works better for you?"
[Book meeting via calendar integration]

IF CASE STUDY:
MAYA: "Perfect — I'll send that right over. Can I confirm this email is correct: {{email}}?"
[Send case study, add to nurture sequence]

IF NOT NOW:
MAYA: "No problem at all. When would be a better time to call back?"
[Schedule callback]
```
