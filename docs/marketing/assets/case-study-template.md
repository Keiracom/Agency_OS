Subject: How {{company_name}} went from {{before_meetings}} to {{after_meetings}} meetings/month

Quick case study:

{{company_name}} ({{industry}}, {{team_size}} people, {{location}}) was stuck in the classic agency trap — great at client work, terrible at marketing themselves.

After switching to Agency OS:
• {{after_meetings}} meetings/month ({{meetings_increase}}x)
• {{hours_saved}} hours/week saved
• {{new_clients}} new clients in {{time_period}}

The ROI: {{roi}}x.
