## Slide-by-Slide Content

---

### Slide 1: Title

**Visual:** Agency OS logo + tagline

**Content:**
```
Agency OS

"Turn strangers into signed clients while you sleep."

Demo for {{company_name}}
{{date}}
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Keep this up while waiting for prospect to join
- Transition immediately when they're ready

---

### Slide 2: Agenda

**Visual:** Simple 3-item list

**Content:**
```
What we'll cover today:

1. Quick discovery — understand your situation (2 min)
2. Live demo — see Agency OS in action (8 min)  
3. Q&A + next steps (5 min)

I promise to keep this tight. Let's dive in.
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Don't linger here
- Shows respect for their time

---

### Slide 3: Discovery (Interactive)

**Visual:** Clean slide with questions

**Content:**
```
Before I show you the product, a few quick questions:

→ What made you book this call today?
→ How are you currently finding new clients?
→ How many hours/week does business development take?
→ What's worked? What hasn't?
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- LISTEN. This is the most important slide.
- Write down exact phrases they use — replay later
- If they mention a specific pain, dig deeper: "Tell me more about that"
- Limit to 2-3 minutes max

---

### Slide 4: The Problem

**Visual:** Split screen — left side frustrated founder, right side stats

**Content:**
```
The Agency BD Trap

Agency founders start because they're great at marketing.
They spend 60% of their time doing sales.

The options aren't great:
❌ Hire a BDM → $80K+ salary + 6-month ramp
❌ Outsource lead gen → Garbage leads, damaged brand
❌ DIY outreach → 20 hours/week, inconsistent results

Result: Feast/famine cycles that never end.
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Tie back to what they said in discovery
- "You mentioned {{their_pain}} — this is exactly what I hear from agencies like yours"
- Don't dwell — they know the problem. Move to solution.

---

### Slide 5: The Solution

**Visual:** Agency OS positioning diagram (5 channels → booked meetings)

**Content:**
```
Agency OS: Your AI Growth Engine

→ Finds ideal clients (8 data sources, AU-focused)
→ Scores every lead (47 signals, 0-100 score)
→ Writes personalised outreach (not templates)
→ Orchestrates 5 channels (email, LinkedIn, SMS, voice, direct mail)
→ Books meetings (qualified, ready to buy)

Built for Australian agencies. ACMA compliant. No spam.

Let me show you how it works...
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- This is the bridge to the demo
- Don't explain features — show them

---

### Slides 6-10: Live Demo

**Format:** Screen share of actual Agency OS dashboard

**Demo Flow:**

#### Slide 6: Dashboard Overview (30 sec)
```
[LIVE SCREEN SHARE]

"This is your command centre. You can see:
- Active campaigns
- Leads in pipeline
- Meetings booked this week
- ALS score distribution"
```

#### Slide 7: Lead Discovery + Scoring (90 sec)
```
[LIVE SCREEN SHARE - Lead Scoring tab]

"Let me show you how we find and score leads.

[Filter for their ICP]

See this lead? Score of 87. Here's why:
- Hired 2 marketing roles last month (growth signal)
- Website updated recently (investment signal)  
- Founder active on LinkedIn (engagement signal)

We only reach out to leads scoring 80+. The rest go into a nurture bucket."
```

#### Slide 8: Outreach Sequences (90 sec)
```
[LIVE SCREEN SHARE - Sequences tab]

"Here's a 4-email sequence we're running.

[Show email 1]

Notice this isn't 'Hi {{first_name}}' — the AI researched this company and pulled a specific reference to their recent work.

[Show multi-channel view]

Same lead is getting:
- Email on Day 1
- LinkedIn connection on Day 2
- SMS on Day 7 (if they opened but didn't reply)
- Voice call on Day 10 (if score is 90+)

All coordinated. All automatic."
```

#### Slide 9: Maya (Voice AI) Demo (60 sec)
```
[LIVE SCREEN SHARE or AUDIO CLIP]

"This is Maya, our AI voice agent. Let me play you a sample call:

[Play 30-second clip of Maya qualifying a lead]

Maya handles:
- Initial qualification
- Objection handling
- Calendar booking

The prospect never knows it's AI."
```

#### Slide 10: Results Dashboard (60 sec)
```
[LIVE SCREEN SHARE - Analytics tab]

"Here's what matters: meetings booked.

For this campaign:
- 500 leads enriched
- 200 reached out to (scored 80+)
- 18 replies (9% reply rate)
- 6 demos booked

That's one demo for every 33 emails. Industry average is 1 in 200.

And I didn't spend 20 hours doing it."
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Use THEIR ICP during the demo if possible (show you did homework)
- Keep each section tight — don't get lost in feature rabbit holes
- If they ask detailed questions, note them: "Great question — let me show you that after pricing"

### Slide 11: Results / Social Proof

**Visual:** Case study summary with metrics

**Content:**
```
Real Results from Real Agencies

🎯 Brisbane Digital Agency (12 people)

   After: 5 hrs/week BD, 12 qualified meetings/month
   Result: 3 new retainer clients ($14K/month MRR added)

🎯 Melbourne SEO Agency (8 people)
   Before: Founder doing all sales, burnt out
   After: AI handling top-of-funnel
   Result: 8 demos in first month, 2 closes

🎯 Sydney Creative Agency (15 people)
   Before: Tried Instantly, HeyReach — neither worked
   After: 5-channel orchestration
   Result: 47% demo show rate (industry avg: 35%)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Pick the case study closest to their situation
- If possible, offer to connect them with a reference

```

**Speaker Notes:**

### Slide 13: Next Steps

**Visual:** Simple 3-step path

**Content:**
```
Next Steps

Option A: Let's Do This
→ I'll send the proposal today
→ You sign + pay first month
→ Kickoff call this week
→ Live in 14 days

Option B: Need to Think
→ I'll send info + case studies
→ We schedule a follow-up for [date]
→ Founding spots held for 7 days

Option C: Not Right Now
→ No pressure — timing matters
→ We can revisit in 90 days

What feels right for {{company_name}}?
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- ASK FOR THE SALE. Don't just end the call.

- If timing: "I understand. Can we schedule a follow-up for [specific date]?"
- Always get a commitment to SOMETHING — next call, proposal review, etc.

### During the Call
- [ ] Start with discovery — don't pitch immediately
- [ ] Use their words back to them
- [ ] Demo to their pain, not all features
- [ ] Watch for buying signals (leaning in, detailed questions)
- [ ] Handle objections with questions, not arguments
- [ ] Always ask for the next step

### After the Call
- [ ] Send summary email within 1 hour
- [ ] Send proposal if they were warm/hot
- [ ] Log notes in CRM
- [ ] Schedule follow-up if needed

## Common Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | "What would you expect to pay for a BDM delivering 10+ meetings a month? Agency OS is less than 2% of one month's salary." |
| "AI outreach is spammy" | "Agreed — most is. Let me show you the difference. [show personalised example] This took the AI 47 seconds. It would take a human 15 minutes." |
| "We tried automation before" | "What specifically didn't work? [listen] That's common with single-channel tools. We're multi-channel with lead scoring — totally different approach." |
| "Need to talk to my partner" | "Of course. Would it help if I jumped on a quick call with both of you? I can do a condensed 10-minute version." |
| "Not the right time" | "When would be better? I'll put a reminder to follow up. [get specific date]" |
| "Can you do a trial?" | "We don't do free trials — setup takes real effort. But we do have a 90-day satisfaction guarantee for founding members." |
