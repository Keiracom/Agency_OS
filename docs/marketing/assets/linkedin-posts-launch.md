## Post 1: Launch Announcement (Day 1 — Monday)

```
🚀 After 18 months of building in the margins, I'm launching Agency OS.

Here's the backstory most people don't know:

I'm an NBN tech. Full-time. Two kids. Third on the way. I built this at 4am before the kids woke up, in the car between jobs, and on weekends when I should've been sleeping.

Why?

Because I saw a gap: 

Every AI sales tool I tested was built for US enterprise companies. None of them understood the Australian market. None of them were ACMA compliant. None of them had local phone numbers.

So I built Agency OS — an AI-powered growth system specifically for Australian marketing agencies.

What it does:
→ Finds ideal clients across 5 channels (email, LinkedIn, SMS, voice, direct mail)
→ Scores every lead with 47 signals so you only talk to hot prospects
→ Books meetings while you're focused on client work

I'm looking for 20 founding agencies to help shape the product.

50% off for life. Direct Slack access with me. Your input shapes the roadmap.

Comment "FOUNDING" if you want details.

(And no, this isn't some fake scarcity. I literally can only support 20 agencies with white-glove onboarding right now.)

## Post 2: Building with AI (Day 3 — Wednesday)

```
I'm not a developer.

I can't write Python. I barely understand JavaScript. A year ago, I couldn't read an API doc without feeling like I was having a stroke.

But I've built a full SaaS product.

15 API integrations. AI-powered lead scoring. Multi-channel automation. Real-time analytics dashboard.

How?

Claude. Cursor. Brutal honesty with myself about what I didn't know.

And 18 months of failing, learning, and trying again.

The barrier to building software isn't coding anymore.

The barrier is:
— The will to start when you have no time
— The ability to keep going when it breaks (and it WILL break)
— The humility to accept you don't know what you're doing

The tools are democratised. The persistence isn't.

Who else is building something without a traditional technical background?

I'd love to hear your story. Drop it in the comments.

## Post 3: The Problem We Solve (Day 5 — Friday)

```
The dirty secret of agency life:

You started an agency because you're great at marketing.
You spend 60% of your time doing sales.

The feast/famine cycle never ends.

I talked to 47 agency founders before building Agency OS. Every single one said some version of:

"I just want to focus on the work. The business development is killing me."

But here's the trap:

→ Hiring a BDM costs $80K+ (and they take 6 months to ramp)
→ Outsourcing lead gen gets you garbage leads
→ DIY outreach is a 20-hour-a-week black hole

So you stay stuck. Great at marketing. Terrible at marketing yourself.

Agency OS is my answer to this:

AI that does the prospecting, qualifying, and booking — so you can do what you actually started the agency to do.

Built for Australia. ACMA compliant. No spam.

If this resonates, I'm taking 20 founding agencies. Link in comments.

## Post 4: First Results (Day 8 — Monday)

```
We just ran our first campaign using Agency OS to sell Agency OS.

Here's exactly what happened:

📊 The Numbers:
— 500 leads enriched (Australian agencies, 5-50 employees)
— 42 scored 85+ by our AI Lead Scoring system
— 200 emails sent (4-touch sequence)
— 18 replies (9% reply rate)
— 6 demos booked (3% demo rate from cold)

That's a demo booked for every 33 cold emails.

And the AI did 95% of the work.

Here's the part that surprised me:

The leads that replied weren't the ones I expected. Our AI lead scoring caught signals I wouldn't have noticed:

— A company hiring for marketing roles (growth signal)
— Website updated in last 30 days (investment signal)
— Founder active on LinkedIn (engagement signal)

Human intuition would've missed 4 of those 6 demos.

The full breakdown is in the blog post (link in comments).

Eating our own cooking. And it tastes pretty good.

## Post 5: Objection Handling (Day 10 — Wednesday)

```
"AI outreach is spammy and damages brand."

I hear this every demo. And honestly? They're usually right.

Most AI outreach IS terrible:
— Generic templates with {first_name} placeholders
— Obvious automation patterns
— No understanding of the recipient's actual situation

But here's what's different about Agency OS:

1. We research before we reach. The AI reads LinkedIn, websites, and recent news before writing a single word.

2. We score before we send. If a lead scores below 70, we don't reach out. No point annoying someone who'll never buy.

3. Multi-channel means natural. Email + LinkedIn + SMS feels like a person. Email alone x 50 feels like a robot.

4. We measure show rate, not send rate. Vanity metrics are worthless. Did the meeting happen? That's what matters.

The agencies using Agency OS aren't worried about brand damage.

Because their outreach actually sounds like them — just scaled.

If you've been burned by automation before, I get the hesitation. Happy to show you the difference.

## Post 6: Founder Story (Day 12 — Friday)

```
10 years ago, I was climbing radio towers for a living.

Today, I'm launching an AI SaaS company.

Here's the non-linear path:

🔧 2015: NBN technician. Crawling under houses, pulling cables. Hard work. Honest money.

📱 2018: Started selling phones on the side. Learned I could sell.

🏠 2020: First kid arrives. Mortgage gets real. Started looking for ways to earn more without trading more hours.

💡 2022: Discovered AI. Spent every spare hour learning prompt engineering, automation, APIs.

🔨 2024: Started building Agency OS. Failed 3 times. Burned through 2 technical co-founders. Decided to just learn it myself.

🚀 2026: Here we are. 18 months later. Launching.

None of this happened because I was smart or talented.

It happened because I was desperate enough to not quit.

If you're building something on the side while working a full-time job and raising a family — I see you. Keep going.

The gap between "crazy side project" and "real business" is smaller than you think.

## Post 7: Social Proof (Day 15 — Monday)

```
First customer case study is in. 🎉

Here's what happened when a 12-person Brisbane digital agency started using Agency OS:

Before:
— Founder spent 25 hours/week on business development
— 2-3 qualified leads per month
— Feast/famine revenue (Q3 was brutal)
— Tried Instantly, HeyReach, Apollo — none worked long-term

After 6 weeks with Agency OS:
— 12 qualified meetings booked from cold outreach
— 3 new retainer clients signed ($14K/month added MRR)
— Founder now spends 5 hours/week on BD
— 20 hours/week returned to billable client work

ROI calculation:
— Agency OS cost: $2,500/month
— Revenue generated: $14,000/month
— 5.6x ROI in the first 6 weeks

Her exact words: "I feel like I finally have a sales team, but without the overhead, HR drama, and training ramp."

That's the goal.

Not more emails sent. Not more LinkedIn connections.

More signed clients.

Full case study going up on the site this week. DM me if you want early access.

## Post 8: ACMA Compliance (Day 17 — Wednesday)

```
Fun fact: 90% of AI outreach tools will get you fined in Australia.

Here's why:

The ACMA has specific rules about commercial electronic messages:
— Sender must be clearly identified
— Functional unsubscribe mechanism required
— Consent or "inferred consent" from business relationship
— 5 business days max to action unsubscribes

Most US-built tools ignore all of this because it doesn't apply to them.

But if you're an Australian agency reaching out to Australian prospects?

You're subject to ACMA. And the fines are real — up to $2.22 million for serious breaches.

That's why we built Agency OS Australia-first:

✅ All emails include ABN and sender identification
✅ One-click unsubscribe on every message
✅ Automatic suppression list management
✅ Australian phone numbers for SMS/voice
✅ Timezone-aware sending (nobody gets an email at 3am)

Compliance isn't sexy. But getting fined is even less sexy.

If you're using an AI outreach tool right now, check if it's ACMA compliant. If you're not sure, assume it isn't.

Happy to audit your current setup — no charge. DM me.

## Post 9: Behind the Tech (Day 19 — Friday)

```
People ask me how Agency OS actually works.

Here's the non-technical explanation:

🔍 DISCOVERY
We plug into 8 data sources (Apollo, LinkedIn, ABR, etc.) to find agencies matching your ideal client profile. Size. Industry. Location. Tech stack. Hiring signals.

📊 SCORING
Every lead gets a 0-100 score based on 47 signals. Intent data. Engagement. Website activity. Recent news. The AI weighs these to predict who's actually ready to buy — not just who fits the profile.

✍️ WRITING
For leads scoring 80+, the AI researches them deeply (LinkedIn, website, recent content) and writes personalised outreach. Not templates. Not mail merge. Actual personalisation.

📱 ORCHESTRATION
Messages go out across 5 channels: email, LinkedIn, SMS, voice AI, and even direct mail for high-value leads. The AI decides which channel, what timing, and what message based on the lead's behaviour.

📅 BOOKING
When someone's interested, the AI qualifies them (Are they actually decision-makers? Is there budget?) and books directly into your calendar. You just show up.

That's it. Discovery → Scoring → Writing → Orchestration → Booking.

The whole thing runs while you sleep.

## Post 10: Founding Spots Update (Day 22 — Monday)

```
Update on Agency OS founding spots:

We started with 20.

We're down to 6.

Here's who's joined so far:

✅ 3 digital marketing agencies (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane)
✅ 2 creative/branding agencies (Adelaide, Perth)  
✅ 4 SEO/performance agencies (various)
✅ 2 B2B lead gen agencies (Melbourne)
✅ 3 full-service agencies (Sydney, Gold Coast)

What founding members get:
— 50% off for life (locked to $1,250/month forever)
— Direct Slack channel with me for support
— Feature request priority (you shape the roadmap)
— "Founding Member" badge + case study opportunity

Why the limit?

Because I'm doing white-glove onboarding for every founding agency. Personally. That doesn't scale beyond 20 right now.

After founding spots fill, price goes to $2,500/month. No exceptions.

If you've been on the fence, this is the nudge.

Comment "FOUNDING" or DM me for details.

(Not forcing anyone's hand. But wanted to be transparent about where we're at.)

## Hashtag Strategy

**Always include (2-3 per post):**
- `#agencylife` or `#agencyowner`
- `#aiautomation` or `#aimarketing`
- One contextual tag

**Avoid:**
- More than 5 hashtags (looks spammy)
- Trending tags unrelated to content
