# Growth Partnership Proposal

## Prepared for {{company_name}}

**Prepared by:** Dave | Founder, Agency OS  
**Date:** {{date}}  
**Valid for:** 14 days

---

## Executive Summary

{{first_name}},

Thank you for taking the time to explore Agency OS. After our conversation, I'm confident we can help {{company_name}} solve the challenge you described: **{{primary_pain_point}}**.

This proposal outlines how Agency OS will:

1. **Free up {{hours_saved}} hours per week** currently spent on business development
2. **Generate {{meeting_target}} qualified meetings per month** through AI-powered multi-channel outreach
3. **Add predictable pipeline** so you can focus on client delivery instead of hunting for new business

Based on your goals and current situation, I'm recommending the **{{recommended_tier}}** plan with a founding member discount.

## The Challenge

During our demo, you shared that {{company_name}} is experiencing:

- [ ] {{pain_point_1}}
- [ ] {{pain_point_2}}
- [ ] {{pain_point_3}}

**Current State:**
- Time spent on BD weekly: **{{current_bd_hours}} hours**
- Qualified meetings per month: **{{current_meetings}}**
- Average close rate: **{{close_rate}}%**

## The Solution: Agency OS

Agency OS is an AI-powered growth operating system built exclusively for Australian marketing agencies.

### How It Works for {{company_name}}

**Step 1: Discovery & Enrichment**
We identify your ideal clients using 8 data sources. Based on our conversation, your ICP includes:
- {{icp_attribute_1}}
- {{icp_attribute_2}}
- {{icp_attribute_3}}

**Step 2: AI Lead Scoring**
Every lead receives a 0-100 score based on 47 signals. Only leads scoring 80+ enter your outreach sequence. This means no wasted time on prospects who'll never buy.

**Step 3: Multi-Channel Orchestration**
Agency OS engages prospects across 5 channels:
| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Email | Primary outreach, 4-touch sequences |
| LinkedIn | Connection requests + messaging |
| SMS | High-intent lead re-engagement |
| Voice AI (Maya) | Calls to leads scoring 90+ |
| Direct Mail | Personalised postcards for enterprise targets |

**Step 4: Qualification & Booking**
When a lead expresses interest, our AI qualifies them (decision-maker? budget? timeline?) and books directly into your calendar. You just show up.

## What We Need From You

To ensure success, we'll need:

1. **Access:** CRM login, calendar integration, email domain setup
2. **Time:** 60-min kickoff + 30-min weekly calls (first month)
3. **Input:** ICP validation, messaging approval, lead list review
4. **Feedback:** Report meeting quality, deal outcomes, prospect feedback

**Our commitment:** We measure success by meetings that show up, not emails sent. If it's not working, we fix it.

## Guarantee

### The Show Rate Promise

We don't count a meeting unless it happens.

If a prospect no-shows, it doesn't count toward your monthly meeting target. We re-engage them or replace them with another qualified meeting.

**Our goal is the same as yours: signed clients.**

### Founding Member Protection

If after 90 days you're not seeing measurable ROI, you can:
- A) Switch plans (up or down)
- B) Pause for 30 days while we recalibrate
- C) Exit with no penalty (founding commitment waived)

We're betting on our product. We want you to feel confident betting on us.
