# Agency OS Pricing Tiers

**Last Updated:** January 4, 2026  
**Status:** LOCKED  
**Currency:** AUD

## Core Principle

> **All tiers include ALL features. Pay for volume, not features.**

The ONLY differences between tiers are:
1. **Lead pool** — Monthly prospect quota
2. **Max campaigns** — Simultaneous active campaigns  
3. **HeyReach seats** — LinkedIn automation capacity

Unused leads do NOT roll over to next month.

### Max Campaigns

- Only "Active" status counts toward limit

### HeyReach Seats

- Can send ~17 connection requests/day (LinkedIn limit)
- Can send ~50 messages/day to connections
- Monthly capacity: ~350 new connections + messages per seat

## Channel Access by ALS Score

Channels are gated by lead score, NOT by tier:

| ALS Score | Tier | Channels Available |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| 85-100 | Hot | Email, LinkedIn, Voice, SMS, Direct Mail |
| 60-84 | Warm | Email, LinkedIn, Voice |
| 35-59 | Cool | Email, LinkedIn |
| 20-34 | Cold | Email only |
| 0-19 | Dead | None (suppressed) |

This applies equally to all pricing tiers.

## Upgrade Path

Customers can upgrade tier at any time:
- Prorated billing for remainder of month
- New limits effective immediately
- No penalty or friction

Downgrade:
- Takes effect at next billing cycle
- Current month limits remain until renewal

---

## What This Means for Sales

**Simple pitch:**
> "Every plan includes everything. Pick your volume. Start with Ignition, upgrade when you need more capacity."

**No feature FOMO:**
- Don't sell "you need Velocity to get Voice AI" — everyone gets Voice AI
- Don't sell "Dominance includes advanced analytics" — everyone gets analytics
- Only sell volume: "You're running out of leads? Time to upgrade."

**Founding member urgency:**
> "17 of 20 spots remaining. Lock in 50% off for life."
