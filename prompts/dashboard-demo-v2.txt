Create an animated dashboard demo component for a SaaS landing page. This is a fake browser window showing a dashboard preview.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Dark theme with bg-[#0a0a0f] background
- Browser chrome frame with macOS traffic light buttons (red, yellow, green dots)
- URL bar showing "app.agencyos.com.au" with a lock icon

DASHBOARD CONTENT (all static, no complex animations):
1. Stats Row (4 cards in a grid):
   - Pipeline: $284K with "↑ 12%" green badge
   - Meetings: 47 with "↑ 8 this week" green badge
   - Reply Rate: 12% with "↑ 2.1%" green badge
   - Leads: 2,847 with "Active" blue badge

2. Two-column layout below stats:
   LEFT - Live Activity Feed:
   - Header with pulsing green dot and "Live Activity" title, "Auto-updating" label
   - 5 activity items showing: name, company, action (e.g., "Opened email", "Clicked link", "Accepted connection"), channel icon, time ago
   - Each item has a colored icon based on channel (email=blue, linkedin=sky, sms=green, phone=purple, calendar=emerald)

   RIGHT - AI Email Composer:
   - Header with sparkles icon and "AI Writing Email" title
   - "Generating" badge (purple)
   - To: Sarah Chen, Marketing Director
   - Company: Bloom Digital
   - Email content area with monospace font showing a personalized sales email
   - Blinking cursor at the end

3. Bottom section - Lead Quality Distribution:
   - "Lead Quality Distribution" header with "Agency Lead Score (ALS)" label
   - 5 horizontal progress bars: Hot (24%, red), Warm (31%, orange), Cool (28%, blue), Cold (12%, gray), Dead (5%, dark gray)

STYLING:
- Use rounded-xl for cards with bg-white/5 and border border-white/10
- Text colors: white for primary, white/50 for secondary, white/40 for tertiary
- All animations should be smooth CSS transitions only - NO rapid state changes
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Import icons from lucide-react

IMPORTANT:
- Keep animations simple and performant - avoid rapid re-renders
- Use CSS animations (animate-pulse, animate-ping) sparingly
- The typing effect should be smooth, not jittery
- All text must be clearly visible with proper contrast
