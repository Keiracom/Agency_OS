3. Score: "ALS Score™ ranks by budget, timeline, and fit" - Description: "Every lead gets an Agency Lead Score (ALS) from 0-100. Focus only on Hot leads (85+) that are ready to close." - Icon: BarChart3
4. Reach: "5-channel outreach: Email, SMS, LinkedIn, Voice, Mail" - Description: "True multi-channel engagement. LinkedIn warms them up, email provides value, voice AI books the meeting." - Icon: Rocket
5. Convert: "Meetings booked on your calendar. Automatically." - Description: "When a lead is ready, our AI handles the booking conversation. You just show up and close." - Icon: Calendar
