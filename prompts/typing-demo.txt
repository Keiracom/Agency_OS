  "Hi Sarah,

  I noticed Bloom Digital has been expanding into healthcare marketing — congrats on the recent wins with Medicare providers.

  We've helped similar agencies book 40+ qualified meetings per month using our multi-channel approach. Given your focus on regulated industries, I think our compliance-first platform could be a great fit.

  Would you be open to a quick 15-min call next week to explore?

  Best,
  Alex"
