## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Keiracom/Agency Use:
**STAY WITH SALESFORGE ECOSYSTEM** - You have the best-value stack:
- Salesforge Growth: $80/mo (unlimited mailboxes, warmup, 50K sends)
- Infraforge: ~$72/mo (10 domains + 20 mailboxes with dedicated IPs)
- **Total: ~$152/mo USD ($236 AUD)**

### If Considering Switch:
**Instantly.ai** is the only serious competitor:
- Cleaner interface
- Better documentation
- But requires same Mailforge/Infraforge for infrastructure
- Net cost: ~$169/mo - marginally more expensive

### Avoid:
- **Per-user tools** (Lemlist, Mailshake, Reply.io for teams) - costs explode
- **Credit-based tools** (Snov.io, Apollo) - hidden costs
- **Warmup-only tools** (Warmbox, Mailreach) - expensive for what they do
