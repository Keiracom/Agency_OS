# DEPRECATED - Do Not Use

**These .md skill files are deprecated and kept only as human reference.**

## Use Python modules instead:

```python
from library.cookbook.skill_index import get_skill_by_trigger, list_skills
from library.cookbook import campaign, conversion, crm_integration
```

Skills have been converted to Python modules in:
- `xero/data/pay/library/cookbook/*.py`
