## How Agents Use Skills

### Builder Agent
1. Reads `skills/agents/BUILDER_SKILL.md` for templates
2. Reads phase skill (e.g., `skills/icp/ICP_SKILL.md`) for requirements
3. Creates code following both

### QA Agent
1. Reads `skills/agents/QA_SKILL.md` for check patterns
2. Reads phase skill for context-specific checks
3. Routes issues correctly (MISSING→Builder, VIOLATION→Fixer)

### Fixer Agent
1. Reads `skills/agents/FIXER_SKILL.md` for fix patterns
2. Reads phase skill for context-specific fixes
3. Applies fixes, documents everything
